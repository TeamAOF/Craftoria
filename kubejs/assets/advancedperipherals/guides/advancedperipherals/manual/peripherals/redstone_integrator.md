# Redstone Integrator

The Redstone Integrator is able to interact with redstone. You can use the same code you would use for a computer on a Redstone Integrator.

You may need this peripheral for cases where you need to output redstone signals on more sides than a regular computer has to offer.

For the full documentation please see the <Color id="blue">[official wiki page](https://docs.intelligence-modding.de/peripherals/redstone_integrator/)</Color>!
