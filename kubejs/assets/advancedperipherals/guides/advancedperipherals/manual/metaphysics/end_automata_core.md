# End automata core

## End automata core

<ItemImage id="advancedperipherals:end_automata_core" />

After consuming 10 endermans, weak automata core will be transformed to end automata core!

In addition to be more powerful weak automata core variant, seems, this soul also provide some limited teleportation abilities for turtle itself.

In additions to weak automata core abilities, this soul also allow limited world-bound teleportation. Seems, you need to store points and then teleport to them!

But be aware, any stored points will be lost after turtle is broken.
