# Muffler Upgrade

This upgrade can be used to suppress sounds and particle effects made by item routers, and can be useful if a noisy module is regularly running in a place where a player often is.
- One or more Muffler Upgrades in a router will disable all audible effects
- Two or more will also disable all particle effects (beams and flying items)


- Three upgrades will also disable the router's active animation; the pulsing texture on the front face of the router block

Note that all sounds and particle effects can also be disabled in the mod config; this upgrade is only useful if sounds/effects have not been disabled.
