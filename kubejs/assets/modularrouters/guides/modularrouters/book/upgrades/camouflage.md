# Camouflage Upgrade

This upgrade allows you to disguise the router as another block. *Sneak+Right-click* the module against a block to record that block on the camouflage upgrade. When inserted into a router, that router will take on the appearance of the recorded block.

Note: holding a *Modular Router* will highlight any nearby camouflaged Routers.
