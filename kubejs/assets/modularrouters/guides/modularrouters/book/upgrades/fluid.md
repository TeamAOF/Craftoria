# Fluid Transfer Upgrade

This upgrade only affects the [Fluid Module Mk1](../modules/fluid.md) and [Fluid Module Mk2](../modules/fluid_2.md).

It increases the overall fluid transfer rate of the [Router](../router/modular_router.md) (in each direction; in & out of the router) from the base rate of 50mB/tick by 10mB/tick, up to a maximum of 400mB/tick. Therefore the maximum number of Fluid Transfer Upgrades in a router is 35.
