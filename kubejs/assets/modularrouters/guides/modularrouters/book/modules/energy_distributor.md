# Energy Distributor Module

This module is like a combination of an [Energy Output](./energy_output.md) and a [Distributor](./distributor.md) Module, in that it can wirelessly distribute FE (Forge Energy) to up to 8 nearby energy-accepting blocks.

*Sneak-right-click* a block to add it to the Energy Distributor Module, and *Sneak-right-click* the block again to remove it.

Like the [Energy Output Module](./energy_output.md), this module can extract energy from either the router's internal energy buffer (if any [Energy Upgrades](../upgrades/energy.md) are installed) or from an energy-containing item in the router's item buffer. The internal energy buffer is used by preference.
