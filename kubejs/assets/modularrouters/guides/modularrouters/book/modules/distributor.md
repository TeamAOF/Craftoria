# Distributor Module

This is an extended version of the [Sender Module Mk2](./sender_2.md), which can send items to multiple targets. *Sneak-right-click* an inventory to add it to the Distributor Module, and *Sneak-right-click* the inventory again to remove it.

The Distributor Module can distribute to up to 8 targets.

A little extra control over distribution strategy is available via the GUI control on the right:
- **Round Robin** - distribute to each inventory in turn, as evenly as possible
- **Random** - pick one of the targets at random
- **Nearest** - always fill the closest target with space for the item
- **Furthest** - always fill the furthest target with space for the item
