# Fluid Module Mk2

Like the [Fluid Module Mk1](./fluid_1.md), this module can transfer fluids into or out of the router, if it has a fluid-containing item in the buffer. However, this module can also target more distant locations, up to 12 blocks away (up to 24 with [Range Up Augments](../augments/range_up.md)).

*Sneak-right-click* any block with the module to set its target.

Note that the target block does not necessarily need to be a fluid tank; if you break the block after setting the module target, the module will be able to empty a bucket of fluid into the world at that location.
