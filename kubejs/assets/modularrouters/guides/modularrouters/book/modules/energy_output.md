# Energy Output Module

This module attempts to output FE (Forge Energy) from the Router to an adjacent energy-receiving block, in its configured direction. The module can extract energy from either the router's internal energy buffer (if any [Energy Upgrades](../upgrades/energy.md) are installed) or from an energy-containing item in the router's item buffer. The internal energy buffer is used by preference.
