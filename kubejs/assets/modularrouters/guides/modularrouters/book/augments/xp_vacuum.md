# XP Vacuum Augment

This augment can only be added to a [Vacuum Module](../vacuum.md).

When this augment is added, the Vacuum Module will absorb experience orbs instead of items. The orbs will be converted into *Bottles o' Enchanting* at the rate of 7XP per bottle (which is the average amount of XP gained by breaking a Bottle o' Enchanting).

Depending on what other mods are installed, it might also be possible to convert orbs into XP fluids. This requires that either a fluid-containing tank is in the router's buffer, or adjacent to the router. In the latter case, ensure that the **Eject** button is enabled in the Vacuum Module's GUI.
