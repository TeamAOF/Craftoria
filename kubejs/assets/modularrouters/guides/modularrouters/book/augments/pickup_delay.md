# Pickup Delay Augment

This augment can only be added to the [Dropper](../modules/dropper.md) and [Flinger](../modules/flinger.md) modules.

It can be stacked; each augment added will increase the pickup delay on dropped/flung items by 10 ticks (0.5 sec). This can be useful if you don't want players accidentally picking up nearby dropped items, for example.
