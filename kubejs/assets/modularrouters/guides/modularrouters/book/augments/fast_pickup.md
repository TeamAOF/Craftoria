# Fast Pickup Augment

This augment can only be added to the [Vacuum Module](../modules/vacuum.md). It allows the Vacuum Module to ignore the normal pickup delay on dropped items - 40 ticks for items dropped by players, and 10 ticks for items dropped by other means (e.g. sheep shearing) - and pick up items as soon as it sees them.

A max of one Fast Pickup Augment can be added.
