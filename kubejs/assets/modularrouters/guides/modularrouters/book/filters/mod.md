# Mod Filter

This filter allows for matching of items by the mod they belong to. Up to 6 mods can be added per installed filter.
- *Right-click* the filter to open its GUI (or *middle-click* / press **<Color id="dark_red">[$(k:modularrouters.configure)]$(/k:modularrouters.configure)</Color>** on a filter which is installed in a module).


- Drop any item into the item slot in the top-left corner of the GUI. The item's mod name will be displayed to the right. Click the **<Color id="dark_green">+</Color>** button to add it to the mod list below.
- Click the red **<Color id="dark_red">X</Color>** button beside an entry to remove that mod from the list.

Vanilla items can be added too, and their "mod" will be shown as *Minecraft*.
