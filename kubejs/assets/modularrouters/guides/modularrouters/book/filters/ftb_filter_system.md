# FTB Filter System

FTB Filter System is a powerful mod which allows many types of filter condition to be combined in interesting ways with an intuitive GUI. If FFS is installed (if you're reading this, it is!), *Smart Filter* items from the mod can be placed in a module's filter slots, and will filter items appropriately.

Limitation: FFS Smart Filters can't be configured while installed as Modular Routers filters can be; you will need to have the filter item in your inventory to reconfigure it.
