# Smart Filters

*Smart Filters* can be inserted into a [module's](./modules.md) filter slots in place of regular items.  Instead of just trying to match against the item directly, filters have special matching functionality.

For example, the [Bulk Item Filter](../filters/bulk_item.md) can efficiently match against up to 54 different items, and its items can be configured from an existing inventory.

*Bulk Item Filter installed in a Puller Mk2 Module*
