# Upgrades

*Upgrades* improve a [Modular Router's](./modular_router.md) functionality in various ways.  There are 8 different upgrade types, and 5 upgrade slots in an Modular Router.

You can put multiple upgrades in an upgrade slot, although there is a limit on how many upgrades of a particular type can be inserted; see the individual upgrade pages or upgrade item tooltips for more information on this.
