# Laser Connector

Multiple [Laser Nodes](./laser_node.md) can be connected directly to each other using the [Laser Wrench](./laser_wrench.md), however the maximum range is 8 blocks. 

Laser Connectors can act as a cheaper intermediary point between nodes, allowing you to build a network of interconnected inventories.
