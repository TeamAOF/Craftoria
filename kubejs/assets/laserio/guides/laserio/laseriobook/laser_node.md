# Laser Node

The Laser Node is the most important block in LaserIO as it allows interaction with adjacent blocks. 

By using Cards such as the [Item Card](./card_item.md), you can interact with the adjacent block to transfer Items, Fluids, Energy, or Redstone.

Each side of a node has a 3x3 grid of inventory slots that accept Cards. Right click a node's side to open it's UI. 

Use the buttons along the top to change which side you're working on, in case the side you want to modify isn't easily accessible.

The adjacent screenshot shows a node interacting with an inventory on it's west side.

Nodes can be connected together using the [Laser Wrench](./laser_wrench.md), allowing connections between distant inventories.  The maximum range between connections is 8 blocks.

If your nodes are father apart, it is recommended to use [Laser Connectors](./laser_connector.md).
