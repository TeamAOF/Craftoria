# Card Cloner

The Card Cloner can be used to 'copy and paste' card settings from one card to another! From within a [Laser Node](./laser_node.md) screen, pickup the Card Cloner (on your cursor) and left click on a card to copy its settings. 

Right click on a card to paste the stored settings.

When pasting, [Overclockers](./overclocker_card.md) and [Filters](./filters.md) will be automatically taken (or placed back) inside the currently available [Card Holder](./card_holder.md). These items will not be pulled out of the player's inventory.

If any of the necessary items are missing, the paste will fail. It will NOT partially paste the settings.
