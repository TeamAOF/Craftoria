# Redstone Mode

Redstone mode determines how a redstone signal on the [Redstone Channel](./redstonechannel.md) will affect a card.

By default, this is set to **ingored** which means the card will always operate, and redstone will not affect it.



If set to low, the cards will only function when there is NOT a redstone signal on the redstone channel (the channel button is to the right of the redstone toggle).

On redstone high mode, the cards will only operate when there IS a redstone signal on the redstone channel.
