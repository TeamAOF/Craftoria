# Tick Speed

Tick Speed is only available on Extractor and Stocker Modes.

This setting determines how quickly a card operates. The default value of 20 ticks means an extractor card will only extract items every 20 ticks, or 1 second.

Extractor and Stocker cards have a default and minimum value of 20, with a maximum value of 1200, unless [Card Overclockers](./overclocker_card.md) are installed.  The following minimum tick speeds are allowed with the designated overclockers installed:
1. 15
2. 10
3. 5
4. 1

If you want to extract items every tick, you need 4 overclockers installed.

Left click on this value to increase it by 1. Right click to decrease it. Holding shift will multiply the change amount by 10, while holding control will multiply the change amount by 64.

These can be combined, meaning holding shift+ctrl will multiply by 640.

For example, shift right click will decrement by 10.
