# Card Overclocker

Card Overclockers allow individual cards to operate more quickly.

For example, Item Cards can only extract at most 8 items every 20 ticks (1 second). With 4 overclockers installed they can reach 64 items per 1 tick!

See the Cards section for more details on how each card is affected by overclockers.
