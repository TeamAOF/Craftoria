# Tier Selection

The <Color id="blue">World Tier Select Screen</Color> is your all-inclusive page for learning about and managing <Color id="gold">World Tiers</Color>.

It can be opened using the "Open World Tier Select" keybind, which defaults to CTRL+T.

## Activating Tiers

Tiers do not activate automatically. When you unlock a new tier, you first need to use the "Activate" button to enable it.

You can select a tier by clicking the Tier's symbol in the screen, and then activate it using the button.

## Tier Information

To view information about a tier, select the tier, then press the "Detailed Info" button.

This will show you the rarity and purity weights for that tier, as well as any Tier Augments that will be applied.

## Notes

You may switch between Tiers at any time.

In multiplayer, multiple players may have different Tiers without impacting eachother. Most content will resolve the Tier of the closest player.
