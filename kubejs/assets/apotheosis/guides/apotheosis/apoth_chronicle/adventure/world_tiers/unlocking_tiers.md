# Unlocking Tiers

Each <Color id="gold">World Tier</Color> must be unlocked before you can enable it (except Haven, which is enabled by default).

Unlocking world tiers is done by completing specific Advancements.

Once a tier is unlocked, you need to activate it in the [Select Screen](./select_screen.md).

## Foreword

This section will cover the default requirements for unlocking world tiers.

Note, modpacks may change these requirements, so be sure to reference the "Apothic World Tiers" advancements tab for complete information.

## Haven

<Color id="blue">Haven</Color> is unlocked by default, though you won't be able to see it until you've picked up your first Affix Item.

## Frontier

<Color id="blue">Frontier</Color> is unlocked by equipping an Affix Item in each armor slot, and holding an Affixed Weapon in either hand.

## Ascent

Unlocking <Color id="blue">Ascent</Color> requires that you equip a full set of <Color id="green">Uncommon</Color> Affix Items, including a weapon.

You'll also need to slay an Apothic Invader.

## Summit

Getting to <Color id="blue">Summit</Color> is a bit harder.

You'll need to acquire a full set of <Color id="blue">Rare</Color> Affix Items, and have slain the Wither.

## Pinnacle

The final tier, <Color id="blue">Pinnacle</Color>, requires that you not only obtain a full set of <Color id="dark_purple">Epic</Color> items, but also that you free The End.

That means slaying the Ender Dragon.
