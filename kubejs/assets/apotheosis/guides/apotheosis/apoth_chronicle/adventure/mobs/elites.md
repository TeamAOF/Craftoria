# Elites

Occasionally, you may see named or empowered mobs throughout your world.

These are likely <Color id="blue">Apothic Elites</Color>.

These mobs will appear randomly in place of their normal counterparts.

They don't have flashy entrances like Invaders do, so be on your guard.

They may also drop Affix Items.
