# Apothic Invaders

A strange noise, a peculiar message, and a giant beam of light from the sky...

All signs point to an incursion from an Apothic Invader!

## Spawn Mechanics

Apothic Invaders may rarely show up on the surface where mobs can normally spawn.

Their arrival will be marked by a loud noise, a status message, and a beacon beam.

Invaders may become more or less common depending on World Tier and Dimension.

## Invader Rarities

Each Invader has a rarity, which is indicated by their name and outline color.

Higher rarity invaders will be stronger, but drop better loot as a result.

## Loot

Invaders are guaranteed to drop a [special affix item](./invader_items.md), and may have additional bonus loot tables beyond their normal mob counterparts.

They also have a higher likelihood of dropping Gems.
