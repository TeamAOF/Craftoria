# Invader Items

Each Invader is empowered with exactly one Affix Item, alongside the rest of their fully enchanted gear.

This Affix Item is guaranteed to be dropped on death, and will be the same rarity as the Invader.

The affixes on it tend to be stronger than usual.

This item alone is the trophy you will take from slaying an invader, and it is likely to be worth it.

As a memento of the original owner, every item will have the invader's name prefixed to the item's name.
