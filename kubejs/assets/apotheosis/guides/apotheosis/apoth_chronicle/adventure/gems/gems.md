# Gems

A <Color id="blue">Gem</Color> is a crystal of condensed strength.

When socketed into an affix item, a Gem will provide a powerful bonus.

Gems may give different bonuses in different items, and can be upgraded.

## Purity

Each gem has a Purity, ranging from <Color id="gray">Cracked</Color> to <Color id="gold">Perfect</Color>.

The purity alone determines the strength of the gem, and higher purity gems are more expensive to upgrade.

A <Color id="gold">Perfect</Color> Gem may no longer be upgraded.

## Obtaining Gems

Gems can be found in chest loot, and may rarely be found when killing mobs. Gem drops are more common for real players, but have a very small chance to drop from machines or other automation sources.

Gems are more likely to drop from Bosses.

## Socketing Gems

To socket a gem into an item, combine the two in a Smithing Table.

Each gem states which items it may fit in.

Some gems are <Color id="dark_red">Unique</Color>, meaning that only one copy of that gem may be socketed in an item.

## Removing Gems

Removing gems from an item was a difficult process, but some clever alchemists figured out how to do it.

Their notes are detailed on the next page.

## Sigil of Withdrawal

Combine a socketed item with a <Color id="blue">Sigil of Withdrawal</Color> in a smithing table to remove the socketed gems from an item. The item and all gems will be returned.
