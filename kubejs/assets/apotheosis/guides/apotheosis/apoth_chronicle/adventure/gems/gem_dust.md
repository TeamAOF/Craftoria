# Gem Dust

<ItemImage id="apotheosis:gem_dust" />

All Apothic Gems can be reduced to 
<Color id="blue">Gem Dust</Color> via crushing.

One method is crushing them with an anvil 
in-world.

## Salvaging Gems

Once you have crushed a few Gems with an anvil, you can create and use the <Color id="blue">Salvaging Table</Color> instead.
