# Attack Knockback

<Color id="blue">Attack Knockback</Color> is how far you knockback enemies when you attack them.

Each point will cause hit enemies to be pushed half a block away.

Weapons and shields may provide this stat.

The Knockback enchantment provides a bonus equivalent to this stat, but it doesn't count towards the max value cap.
