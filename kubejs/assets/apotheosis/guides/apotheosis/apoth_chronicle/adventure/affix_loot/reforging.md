# Reforging

Through the raw potential of <Color id="blue">Rarity Materials</Color> and the versatility of <Color id="blue">Gem Dust</Color>, it is now possible to reforge an item with brand new affixes.

Reforging is not limited to items that already have affixes, and can be performed with any valid item.

To begin reforging, craft a <Color id="rare">Simple Reforging Table</Color>, which allows you to reforge items up to <Color id="rare">Rare</Color> rarity.

<Recipe id="apotheosis:simple_reforging_table" />

## Input Slots

The Reforging Table has three input slots.

The center slot holds the item you wish to reforge.

The top-left slot holds <Color id="blue">Rarity Materials</Color> for the rarity you would like to reforge with.

## Input Slots

The bottom-right slot holds <Color id="blue">Sigils of Rebirth</Color>, a unique fuel item used during the Reforging process.

## Reforging

Similar to an Enchanting Table, when reforging, three choices are offered.

Each choice represents a potential new form of the item being reforged.

No choice is inherently stronger than the others.

## Reforging

For each rarity, there is a base cost of experience, sigils, and materials. The extra choice slots charge double and triple the base cost.

To reforge your item, simply click the desired choice.

To reforge items of <Color id="epic">Epic</Color> rarity or higher, you'll need to upgrade your <Color id="rare">Simple Reforging Table</Color> into a <Color id="epic">Reforging Table</Color>.

## Notes

Items that are not already affixed can be reforged.

Items can be reforged multiple times.

Modpacks can change the costs or prevent reforging at certain rarities.
