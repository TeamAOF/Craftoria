# Augmenting

The <Color id="blue">Augmenting Table</Color> is an end-game crafting station used to augment the individual affixes of an item.

Through it, you can upgrade or reroll single affixes, leaving the rest intact.

Creating an Augmenting Table requires focusing the energy of a <Color id="blue">Nether Star</Color> through two <Color id="blue">Godforged Pearls</Color>, using an <Color id="blue">Enchanting Table</Color> as the base.

## Input Slots

The Augmenting Table has two input slots.

The upper slot holds the item you wish to augment, which must be an affix item.

Typically, you should only augment items of at least <Color id="mythic">Mythic</Color> rarity, though you could consider augmenting <Color id="epic">Epic</Color> ones as well.

## Input Slots

The lower slot holds <Color id="blue">Sigils of Enhancement</Color>, the fuel item used for Augmenting.

Finally, you'll need to select the desired affix from the drop-down menu.

## Upgrading

The first operation that can be performed in the augmenting table is upgrading an affix.

This costs two <Color id="blue">Sigils of Enhancement</Color>, and will upgrade the internal strength of the current affix by 25%.

How much of a boost this provides varies per Affix.

## Rerolling

The second operation of the augmenting table is to reroll an affix.

This costs one <Color id="blue">Sigil of Enhancement</Color> and swaps out the selected affix for another one of the same type.

The alternative options will be shown on the left.
