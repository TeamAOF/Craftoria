# Brutal Spawners

A brutal spawner is a subtype of rogue spawner that spawns mobs that are stronger than usual.

These mobs will have higher health, armor, and damage than their typical counterparts, and are resistant to fire.

The only upside is that these spawners have a significant delay before summoning reinforcements.
