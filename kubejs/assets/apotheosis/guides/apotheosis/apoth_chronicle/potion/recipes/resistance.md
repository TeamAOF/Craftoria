# Resistance

<Color id="blue">Resistance</Color> is a fairly useful effect that has no recipe in vanilla.

Each level gives +20% damage reduction against all sources.

You'll also need it to craft [Sundering](../effects/sundering.md) potions.

## Brewing Recipe

This potion can be crafted with an Awkward Potion and a Shulker Shell.

It can be extended, strengthend, or turned into a splash potion with the usual ingredients.
