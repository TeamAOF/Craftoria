# Absorption

<Color id="blue">Absorption</Color> is an interesting effect.

Each level grants 2 additional temporary hearts.

However, these hearts don't refresh during the duration, so a [Potion Charm](../charms/charm.md) is preferrable.

## Brewing Recipe

It can be extended, strengthend, or turned into a splash potion with the usual ingredients.
