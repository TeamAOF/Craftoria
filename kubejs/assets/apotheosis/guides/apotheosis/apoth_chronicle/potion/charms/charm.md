# Potion Charms

A <Color id="blue">Potion Charm</Color> is a brand new item that helps you get the most out of your potions.

See, while a normal potion requires you to drink it and use the whole effect at once, the <Color id="blue">Potion Charm</Color> lets you stagger it.

## Potion Charm Crafting

A charm is made out of three potions of the same type, and some blaze powder.

A single charm lasts longer than the three potions combined.

## Using Potion Charms

A <Color id="blue">Potion Charm</Color> is only active when it is enabled.

To enable a charm, simply right click with it in-hand.

An enabled charm will start glowing.

As long as the charm is active and in your inventory, it will apply the potion to you, consuming durability.

The charm will only apply a couple seconds of potion at a time.

When the charm runs out of durability, it will break.
