# Sundering

The Potion of <Color id="red">Sundering</Color> is a negative effect.

While under its effects, all damage received is increased by 20% per level.

It serves as a direct counter to resistance, and is additive with resistance.

If you had Sundering II and Resistance II, you would take normal damage.
