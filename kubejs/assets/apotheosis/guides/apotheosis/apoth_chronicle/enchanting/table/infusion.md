# Infusion Enchanting

<Color id="blue">Infusion Enchanting</Color> is a new method of crafting through the Enchantment Table.

Each infusion recipe has a single item input, and three stat requirements.

Each stat requirement will typically require at least some value, and will optionally have a maximum value.

Infusion enchantments only use the third slot, and will let you over-spend experience.

To perform an infusion enchantment, just place the item in the slot.

If you have the correct stats, the third slot will light up, and clicking it will perform the infusion.
