# Enchanting Power

During the enchanting process, you spend experience and Lapis Lazuli to enchant an item.

From this, enchantments are randomly selected using some complex formulas.

This chapter explains that process.

First, we'll go over how enchantments are selected.

Each enchantment has a <Color id="dark_purple">Power Function</Color>, which controls what <Color id="dark_purple">Final Power</Color> will make a specific level available.

Once all the available enchantments are gathered, some are selected randomly based on their weights.

<Color id="dark_purple">Final Power</Color> is calculated using the following steps:

Intially, you have a <Color id="gold">Base Power</Color>, which is the level you spent while enchanting.

Then, <Color id="red">Quanta</Color> and Rectification modify your <Color id="gold">Base Power</Color> to produce your <Color id="dark_purple">Final Power</Color>.

The specifics of how each stat modifies your <Color id="gold">Base Power</Color> can be found in the [<Color id="red">Quanta</Color>](./stats.md#quanta) and [Rectification](./stats.md#rectification) entries.

Typically, a higher <Color id="dark_purple">Final Power</Color> will get you access to higher level enchantments.
