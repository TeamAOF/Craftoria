# Enchanting Seed

Everything in enchanting (and some other mechanics) are based on your <Color id="blue">Enchanting Seed</Color>.

The seed is changed whenever you enchant an item at an enchanting table.

Unless your seed changes, all seed-based random outcomes will remain the same.

For example, what enchantments are selected for a particular slot is a seed-based random outcome.
