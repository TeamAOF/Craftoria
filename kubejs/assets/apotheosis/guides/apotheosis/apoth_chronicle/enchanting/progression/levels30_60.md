# Levels 30 - 60

## Reaching Level 45

To reach level 45, you'll want to create some <Color id="blue">Hellshelves</Color>, and add them to your existing Bookshelves.

## Reaching Level 45

If you aren't fond of the Nether, you can also venture to the Ocean, and create <Color id="blue">Seashelves</Color> instead.

## Reaching Level 60

<ItemImage id="apothic_enchanting:infused_hellshelf" />

Once you reach Level 45, you'll need to explore [Infusion Enchanting](../table/infusion.md) to upgrade your shelves.

## Reaching Level 60

<ItemImage id="apothic_enchanting:infused_seashelf" />

Create a few more of the type of shelf you were using, infuse them, and upgrade them.

These new shelves, on top of your old ones, will let you reach Level 60.

## Enchanting Clues

<ItemImage id="apothic_enchanting:sightshelf" />

You now have access to better options for increasing other stats.

On top of the bonuses from Hellshelves and Seashelves, you may now also create <Color id="blue">Sightshelves</Color> to increase your <Color id="dark_aqua">Enchanting Clues</Color>.

## Quantic Stability

By performing the infusion to create a Budding Amethyst, you can craft a <Color id="blue">Bookshelf of Stability</Color>.

This will prevent you from receiving negative Quanta rolls.
