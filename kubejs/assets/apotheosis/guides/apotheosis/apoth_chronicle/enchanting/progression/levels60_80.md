# Levels 60 - 80

## Reaching Level 70

Reaching Level 70 requires a Level 60 Enchanting Table and access to Deepslate.

<Recipe id="apothic_enchanting:dormant_deepshelf" />

## Reaching Level 70

Once you've crafted a <Color id="blue">Dormant Deepshelf</Color>, you need to infuse it.

This infusion recipe will require some extra blocks to reach the stat threshold.

Completing the infusion will yield a <Color id="blue">Deepshelf</Color>, which can get you to Level 70.

## Reaching Level 75

To hit level 75, you will need to upgrade your Deepshelves.

Doing this requires materials only found in the <Color id="blue">Deep Dark</Color>.

<Color id="blue">Echo Shards</Color> may be looted from the Ancient City, and <Color id="blue">Sculk</Color> may be collected with Silk Touch.

The last step to Level 80 requires slaying the <Color id="blue">Warden</Color>, which allows crafting <Color id="blue">Sculkshelves</Color>.
