# Levels 80 - 100

## Reaching Level 90

<ItemImage id="apothic_enchanting:infused_breath" />

Accessing the penultimate tier requires a Level 80 table and access to <Color id="blue">Dragon's Breath</Color>.

With these, you can create <Color id="blue">Infused Dragon's Breath</Color>, a core component of <Color id="blue">Endshelves</Color>.

## Reaching Level 100

<ItemImage id="minecraft:dragon_head" />

The highest level an Enchanting Table can reach is Level 100, but only one shelf can provide this much power.

Creating such a shelf requires venturing into the outer end to retrieve a <Color id="blue">Dragon Head</Color>.

## Reaching Level 100

A single <Color id="blue">Draconic Endshelf</Color> provides enough raw strength to boost a table from Level 90 to Level 100.

However, it provides no other stat bonuses.
