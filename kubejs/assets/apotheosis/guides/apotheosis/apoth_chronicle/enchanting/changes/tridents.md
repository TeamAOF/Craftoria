# Tridents

Alongside the new enchantments, Tridents may now also receive <Color id="blue">Sharpness</Color>, <Color id="blue">Looting</Color>, and <Color id="blue">Piercing</Color>.

Sharpness and Looting function as they do on swords.

Piercing causes thrown tridents to be able to hit additional enemies.

Apotheosis also adds a method of creating tridents.

Simply create an <Color id="blue">Inert Trident</Color> and upgrade it through [Infusion Enchanting](../infusion.md).
