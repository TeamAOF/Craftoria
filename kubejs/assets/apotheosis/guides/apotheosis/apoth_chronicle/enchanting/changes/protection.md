# Protection

<Color id="blue">Protection</Color> is no longer exclusive with the subtypes of protection.

This means you can now have <Color id="blue">Protection</Color> and one other defensive enchantment that is normally exclusive.

To account for this, the effectiveness of protection enchantments is modified slightly.

Understanding how means learning a bit about how protection works, and some math.

To begin, we introduce the concept of a Damage Reduction (DR) point, which is the stat that all defensive enchantments benefit.

The <Color id="blue">Protection</Color> enchant provides 1 point against all damage types.

Specialized enchants provide 2 points against one specific type.

<Color id="blue">Feather Falling</Color> provides 3 points against fall damage.

In Apotheosis, each Protection point provides 2.5% damage reduction, up to 85%.

In vanilla, each point provides 4% damage reduction, up to 80%.
