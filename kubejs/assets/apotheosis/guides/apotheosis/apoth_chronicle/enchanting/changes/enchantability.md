# Enchantability

In Vanilla, all items without an explicit [Item Enchantability](../table/enchantability.md) have a default of zero.

Apotheosis changes the default to one.

This has the side effect of making some items unintentionally enchantable.

This tweak does not change the enchantability of items that have an explicit value.

Items with an enchantability of zero can never be enchanted.
