# Experience Costs

In Vanilla, things that cost levels (enchantment tables and anvils) take a flat amount of levels from you, no matter how many levels you have.

Apotheosis changes both of these to cost the "optimal" amount of experience.

For enchanting tables, you will be charged the amount of experience as if you always had the exact amount of levels you needed to perform that enchantment.

Similar for anvils, except the cost is from zero (instead of only the top N levels).
