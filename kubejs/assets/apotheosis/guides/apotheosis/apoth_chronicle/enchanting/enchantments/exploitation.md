# Worker Exploitation

<Color id="dark_red">Worker Exploitation</Color> is a Corrupted enchantment for shears.

It causes damage to the sheep when shearing, but doubles all wool drops.

This doubling is applied after <Color id="blue">Fortune</Color>.

Additionally, if combined with <Color id="blue">Chromatic Aberration</Color>, all doubled wool will also be of a random color.
