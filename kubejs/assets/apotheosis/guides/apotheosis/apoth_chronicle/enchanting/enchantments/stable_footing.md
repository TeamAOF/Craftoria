# Stable Footing

<Color id="blue">Stable Footing</Color> is an enchantment for boots.

It causes the break speed penalty for flying to be reversed.

This includes all penalties for not standing on the ground.

When combined with <Color id="blue">Aqua Affinity</Color>, you can have full break speed when swimming.
