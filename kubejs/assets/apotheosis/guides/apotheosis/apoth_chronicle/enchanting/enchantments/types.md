You may notice that some enchantments have different colored names.

This is because Apotheosis introduces three new sub-categories of enchantments.

Each sub-category has a a few rules imposed on them.

## Masterwork

They always require at least 55 <Color hex="#CC00CC">Final Power</Color> to receive.

## Twisted

They always require at least 45 <Color hex="#CC00CC">Final Power</Color> to receive.

## Corrupted

<Color id="dark_red">Corrupted</Color> enchantments have a health cost associated with their effect.

They always require at least 65 <Color hex="#CC00CC">Final Power</Color> to receive.

They are considered to be <Color id="red">curses</Color>.
