# Enchantment Types

You may notice that some enchantments have different colored names.

This is because Apotheosis introduces three new sub-categories of enchantments.

Each sub-category has a a few rules imposed on them.

## Masterwork

<Color id="dark_green">Masterwork</Color> enchantments represent the strongest and rarest enchantments.

They always require at least 55 <Color id="dark_purple">Final Power</Color> to receive.

## Twisted

<Color id="dark_purple">Twisted</Color> enchantments always have one good and one bad effect.

They always require at least 45 <Color id="dark_purple">Final Power</Color> to receive.

## Corrupted

<Color id="dark_red">Corrupted</Color> enchantments have a health cost associated with their effect.

They always require at least 65 <Color id="dark_purple">Final Power</Color> to receive.

They are considered to be <Color id="red">curses</Color>.
