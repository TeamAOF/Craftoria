# Reflective Defenses

<Color id="blue">Reflective Defenses</Color> is a shield enchantment.

It causes all blocked attacks to inflict a portion of the damage back at the attacker.

More specifically, 15% of the damage blocked is reflected back.

Reflected damage is transformed into magic damage.

Sufficiently high levels of <Color id="blue">Reflective Defenses</Color> will inflict more than the original damage.
