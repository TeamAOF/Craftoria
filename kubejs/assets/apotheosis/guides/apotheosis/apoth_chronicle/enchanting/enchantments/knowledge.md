# Knowledge of the Ages

<Color id="dark_green">Knowledge of the Ages</Color> is a Masterwork
enchantment that can be applied to swords.

When you kill a mob, all drops will be converted to experience.

Each individual item is worth the same amount of experience.

This makes it most efficient to kill mobs that drop a large volume of items.

The experience per item increases with enchantment level.

As a precaution, killing a player will not convert their items.
