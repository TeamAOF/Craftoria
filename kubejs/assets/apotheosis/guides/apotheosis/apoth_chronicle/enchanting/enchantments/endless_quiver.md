# Endless Quiver

<Color id="dark_green">Endless Quiver</Color> is a Masterwork enchantment for bows.

When firing a bow, arrows are not consumed, no matter the type.

It is considered a direct upgrade from <Color id="blue">Infinity</Color>.

This enchantment should even make arrows from other mods infinite.
