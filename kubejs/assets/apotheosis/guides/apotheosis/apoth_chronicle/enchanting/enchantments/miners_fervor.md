# Miner's Fervor

<Color id="dark_purple">Miner's Fervor</Color> is a Twisted enchantment that can be applied to all tools.

It causes you to break blocks very quickly, but never instantaneously.

It is exclusive with <Color id="blue">Efficiency</Color>.

Despite having a speed cap, the per-level boost is much higher than <Color id="blue">Efficiency</Color>.

This makes it an ideal choice for tools with a slow base speed.
