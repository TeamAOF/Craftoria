# Enchantment Filtering

Sometimes, it is desirable to avoid certain enchantments entirely during the enchanting process.

The <Color id="blue">Seashelf of Aquatic Filtration</Color> allows you to do just that.

## Aquatic Filtration

The shelf allows you to insert up to six single-enchantment books in it, preventing those enchantments from appearing.

<Recipe id="apothic_enchanting:filtering_shelf" />

To use it, simply insert a single-enchantment book of an enchantment you wish to blacklist.

The enchantment will then no longer be available in the Enchanting Table.

The shelf will also gain <Color hex="#3DB53D">Eterna</Color> and <Color hex="#A800A8">Arcana</Color> based on the number of books inserted.

Note: books can be inserted the same way you use a chiseled bookshelf, and the shelf must be in a valid bookshelf slot to operate.

Blacklisted enchantments will be reflected in the [Enchanting Info Screen](../table/info.md).
