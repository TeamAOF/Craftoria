# Enchantment Library

An Enchantment Library is a storage system for Enchantments.

Simply insert enchanted books, and every enchantment on the book will be stored as points.

Each library has a <Color id="gold">Level Capacity</Color>, representing the highest level of enchantment it can store.

Excess enchantments are voided.

Clicking on a stored enchantment will extract one level of that enchantment.

Shift-clicking a stored enchantment will extract as many levels as possible.

Books are generated in the output slot as necessary.

You may also place a book in the output slot to add enchantments to it.

The library records the max level that has ever been inserted for each enchantment, and can only extract up to that level.

The standard <Color id="blue">Enchantment Library</Color> has a <Color id="gold">Level Capacity</Color> of sixteen (XVI).

The <Color id="blue">Library of Alexandria</Color> has a <Color id="gold">Level Capacity</Color> of thirty-one (XXXI).

It cannot be crafted directly, and must be created using [Infusion Enchanting](../infusion.md).
