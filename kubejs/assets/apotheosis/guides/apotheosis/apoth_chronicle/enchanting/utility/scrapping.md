# Tome of Scrapping

The Tome of Scrapping is a way of retrieving enchantments from an item.

Combining one with another item in an anvil will destroy the other item, and make a book with some of the enchantments at random.

You will always receive half of the enchantments (rounded up).

The enchantments selected are based on your [Enchanting Seed](../seed.md).
