# Treasure Enchantments

Treasure enchantments are special enchantments that are typically unavailable in the Enchanting Table.

However, this can be remedied with a <Color id="blue">Deepshelf of Arcane Treasures</Color>.

## Arcane Treasures

Placing this bookshelf in a valid slot will cause treasure enchantments to appear while enchanting.

Bear in mind that most <Color id="dark_red">Curses</Color> are treasure enchantments.
