# Capturing

Mob Spawners can have their entity changed by using a <Color id="blue">Spawn Egg</Color>.

Typically, these are unobtainable. To remedy this, Apotheosis adds the <Color id="blue">Capturing</Color> enchantment for swords.

## Spawn Eggs

<ItemImage id="minecraft:cow_spawn_egg" />

Each level of the <Color id="blue">Capturing</Color> enchantment gives you an 0.4% chance for entities to drop their spawn egg on death.

Entities without a spawn egg item (as seen in JEI) cannot drop one.
