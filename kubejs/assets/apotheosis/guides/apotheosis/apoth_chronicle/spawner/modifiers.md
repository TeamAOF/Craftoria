# Spawner Modifiers

After reading about [Spawner Stats](./stats.md), you may be wondering how to change them.

Enter <Color id="blue">Spawner Modifiers</Color>, a system to edit spawners.

A modifier consists of up to two items, and produces a certain change in a spawner's stats.

## Viewing Modifiers

Every single modifier is visible in JEI.

They can be accessed by looking at both the uses and recipes for <Color id="blue">Mob Spawners</Color>, or the uses for the modifier items.

There's a lot of tooltips in there, so look around.

## Notation

In JEI, stat changes are noted as
<Color id="blue">+/- X Stat</Color>.

Some stats do not have numerical values, so they will be shown as <Color id="blue">+/- Stat</Color>.

In tooltips, non-numeric stats are not shown unless enabled.

## Modifier Caps

Certain modifiers cannot reduce or increase stats past a certain value.

These will be noted in the tooltip for that particular stat in JEI.

These caps are modifier-specific, so one modifier may have a different cap than another for the same stat.

## Applying Modifiers

To apply a modifier, simply hold the respective items in your hands, and right-click the <Color id="blue">Mob Spawner</Color>.

If the modification is successful, the items will be consumed.

The main item is always consumed, but the secondary item may not be.

Even though JEI states that items must be held in particular hands, that is not required.

You can apply a modifier as long as you are holding the items in your hands, regardless of which hand.
