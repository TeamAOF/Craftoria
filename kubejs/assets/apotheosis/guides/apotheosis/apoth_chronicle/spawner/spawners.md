# Mob Spawners

A <Color id="blue">Mob Spawner</Color> is a magical block that can funnel in entities from the void.

But you knew that already, so let's get on to the new stuff.

In Apotheosis, spawners can be picked up with <Color id="blue">Silk Touch</Color>.

Harvesting a spawner in that way will incur an additional durability cost.

Mob spawners have a series of [Spawner Stats](./stats.md) which control their functionality.

These stats can be changed using [Spawner Modifiers](./modifiers.md).
