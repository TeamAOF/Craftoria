# Wandering Trader

Have you ever met one of those shady merchants that just appear on your lawn?

Those are called <Color id="blue">Wandering Traders</Color>.

Typically they only sell hot garbage.

However, Apotheosis adds a ton of new trades to their tables so they are actually worth interacting with.

These trades include items like <Color id="blue">Beacons</Color> or <Color id="blue">Totems of Undying</Color>, and heavily enchanted diamond gear.

Apotheosis also improves the spawn rates of Wandering Traders, and allows them to spawn underground, instead of only on the surface.
