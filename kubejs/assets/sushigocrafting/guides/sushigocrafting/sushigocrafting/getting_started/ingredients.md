# Ingredients

Ingredients are 'usually' processed food ready to used when making food, most of them will have a weight to them and their weights can be combined in the crafting table or in a [Cooler Box](../using_tools/cooler_box.md) to do it in automated way. 

If ingredients don't combine it might be because it goes over the max amount.

Most ingredients have an affect attached to them or an effect modifier that will modify/amplify effects from other ingredients.
