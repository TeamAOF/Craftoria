# Drone Condition: Upgrades Widget

The *Drone Condition: Upgrades* widget lets you check the number of installed upgrades in this [Drone](../tools/drone.md). Specify the upgrade(s) to be checked by using one or more attached [Item Filter](./item_filter.md) widgets, set to the upgrade item(s) to be checked; without any filter, all installed upgrades of all types will be counted.
