# Jump Subroutine Widget

This widget behaves like *Jump* except when the subroutine has completed, execution will continue in the widget connected to the bottom of the *Jump Subroutine* widget. A *Jump Subroutine* widget is useful for reusing common code and calling subroutines with arbitrary arguments by assigning variables before jumping to the subroutine.
