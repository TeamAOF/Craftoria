# Void Fluid Widget

Like the [Void Item widget](./void_item.md), this will immediately and permanently destroy any fluid in the drone's tank - beware! It is very strongly recommended to use this in conjunction with an [Liquid Filter](./liquid_filter.md). With a filter, only fluid allowed by the filter will be voided.

*All dried up*
