# Drone Condition: Entity Widget

This is a [Condition](./conditions.md) widget.

The *Drone Condition: Entity* widget allows you to check the entity this [Drone](../tools/drone.md) is currently carrying. You can add an optional [Text](./text.md) widget with an [Entity Filter](../base_concepts/entity_filter.md), to filter the entity to check for. With no *Text* widget, the condition will be true if *any* entity is carried.
