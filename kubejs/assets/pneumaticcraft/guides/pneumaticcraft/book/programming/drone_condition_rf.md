# Drone Condition: RF Widget

This is a [Condition](./conditions.md) widget.

The *Drone Condition: RF* widget allows you to check the amount of *Forge Energy (FE)* carried by this [Drone](../tools/drone.md).

*Despite its name, this widget checks FE, not RF (Redstone Flux). The name is historical.*
