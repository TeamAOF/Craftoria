# Condition: Coordinate Widget

This is a [Condition](./conditions.md) widget.

The *Condition: Coordinate* widget compares two [Coordinates](./coordinate.md). Different tests can be done on these coordinates, and more specifically on every axis (X/Y/Z) of the coordinate. You can check if just one axis of both coordinates matches, or two, or all three.

The axis or axes being compared are defined by the checkboxes in the widget's GUI. Similarly, the condition to use ('=', '>=') is defined by the radio buttons in the GUI.

Your coordinate comparison is also displayed textually in the GUI (e.g. *x1 <= x2 and z1 <= z2*).
