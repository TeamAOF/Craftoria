# Crafting Widget

The [Drone](../tools/drone.md) will craft items using items it has in its inventory. To specify a crafting recipe, place [Item Filters](./item_filter.md) on the right side of the Crafting widget, in the pattern of the crafting recipe.

You don't need to use exactly 9 *Item Filters*: as long as you can create the recipe pattern, it will work.

By default the Crafting widget will try to craft as many items as possible; you can limit this in the widget GUI with the *Use Count* setting.

You will probably want to install some [Inventory Upgrades](../base_concepts/upgrades.md#dispenser) in the *Drone* to give it a larger inventory.

## JEI Integration

It is possible to quickly and easily set up Item Filters for the Crafting widget using JEI; see [this page](./programmer.md#jei) for more information.
