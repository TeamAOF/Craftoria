# Logistics Widget

This widget makes the [Drone](../drone.md) behave like a [Logistics Drone](../logistics_drone.md), but allows some extra flexibility over the base Logistic Drone functionality:
- It can be used with other widgets, e.g. a [Standby](./standby.md) widget for more efficient air usage
- A custom [Area](./area.md) can be defined (a standard Logistics Drone has a 33x33x33 area centered on the drone, which cannot be changed)
