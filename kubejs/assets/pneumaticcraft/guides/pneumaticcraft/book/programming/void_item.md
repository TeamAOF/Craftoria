# Void Item Widget

This will immediately and permanently destroy items in the drone's inventory - beware! It is very strongly recommended to use this in conjunction with an [Item Filter](./item_filter.md). With a filter, only items that are allowed by the filter will be voided.

The widget is done executing when none of the applicable items remain in the *Drone's* inventory.

*Didn't want it anyway*
