# Condition: Pressure Widget

This is a [Condition](./conditions.md) widget.

The *Condition: Pressure* widget allows you to (remotely) check if the [pressure](../base_concepts/pressure.md) of the pneumatic block(s) in the connected [Area](./area.md) widget matches the configured pressure threshold.
