# Export RF Widget

[Drones](../drone.md) have an internal buffer of 100,000 FE (Forge Energy).  Using this widget, you can export energy from the Drone's storage to an energy-providing block (e.g. a *Thermal Expansion Energy Cell* or *Immersive Engineering Capacitor*).

*Despite its name, this widget exports FE (Forge Energy), not RF (Redstone Flux). The name is historical.*
