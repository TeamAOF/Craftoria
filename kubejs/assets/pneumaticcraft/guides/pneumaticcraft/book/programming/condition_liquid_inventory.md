# Condition: Fluid Widget

This is a [Condition](./conditions.md) widget.

The *Condition: Fluid* widget allows you to (remotely) check tank(s) or fluid block(s) in the connected [Area](./area.md) widget for a certain amount of fluid. It will only count the fluid allowed by a connected [Fluid Filter](./liquid_filter.md) widget (omit the filter to allow every fluid).
