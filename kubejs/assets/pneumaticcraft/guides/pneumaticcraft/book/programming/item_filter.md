# Item Filter Widget

The *Item Filter* is a widget solely used as a *parameter* for other widgets. You can use it to specify which blocks & items may be picked up / placed / mined / etc.

Start by *right-clicking* the widget. Then you can either search for an item in the game by clicking *Search Item...* or you can select an item from your inventory by clicking *Search Inventory...*

Then you can apply some extra filter options to control how the match is done; how these options work is displayed in the tooltips of the checkboxes in the GUI.

As usual, placing this widget to the *right* of its parent acts as a whitelist, and placing it to the *left* acts as a blacklist.
