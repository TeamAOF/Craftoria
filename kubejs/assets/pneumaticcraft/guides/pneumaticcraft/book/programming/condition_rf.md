# Condition: RF Widget

This is a [Condition](./conditions.md) widget.

The *Condition: RF* widget allows you to (remotely) check if the *Forge Energy (FE)* level of the block(s) in the connected [Area](./area.md) widget matches the configured FE threshold.

*Despite its name, this widget checks FE, not RF (Redstone Flux). The name is historical.*
