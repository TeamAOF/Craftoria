# Puzzle Pieces

*Programming Puzzles*, or *Puzzle Pieces*, are the physical items used to program a [Drone](../tools/drone.md) with a [Programmer](./programmer.md). They're used up when a Drone is programmed, but can be retrieved by overwriting the *Drone* with a smaller (or empty) program.

The virtual representations of *Puzzle Pieces* in the *Programmer* GUI are referred to as *Programming Widgets*.

To write a program to a [Drone](../tools/drone.md), you must either have the *Puzzle Pieces* in your inventory, or place them in an inventory adjacent to the *Programmer* (on any side).

If you're in Creative Mode, then programming is completely free; no pieces required.
