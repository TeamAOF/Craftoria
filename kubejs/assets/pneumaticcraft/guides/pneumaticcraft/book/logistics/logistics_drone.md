# Logistics Drone

*Logistics Drones* are a special type of [drone](../tools/drone.md). They are a lower tier *Drone*, since they are not programmable but limited to carrying out *only* logistics tasks.

## Automatic Charging

As with all types of Drone, these drones require [pressure](../base_concepts/pressure.md) to operate, and will automatically seek out [a Charging Station with a Dispenser Upgrade](../tools/drone.md#charging) if low on air.

Once deployed, a *Logistics Drone* will operate on any inventory/tank with a [Logistics Frame](./frames.md) in a 33x33x33 cube centered on the block the drone was deployed at.

Since these Drones frequently need to move items around, [Speed](../base_concepts/upgrades.md#speed) and [Inventory](../base_concepts/upgrades.md#inventory) upgrades are recommended for movement speed and carrying capacity.
