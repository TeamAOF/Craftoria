# Logistics Overview

<Color hex="#228">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color>'s *Logistics System* offers an interesting way to transport items & fluids, and to keep inventories & tanks stocked.

Inventories & tanks can be marked with [Logistic Frames](./frames.md), attachable gadgets which control how items & fluids should be moved into and out of those blocks.

Those inventories are then connected with [Logistics Drones](./logistics_drone.md) or [Pressure Tubes](../tubes/pressure_tubes.md) with [Logistics Modules](../tubes/logistics_module.md) attached.

The *Logistics System* is heavily inspired by [Factorio](https://wiki.factorio.com/Logistic_network), and if you've played that game, the concepts will be familiar. The primary difference is that this mod provides [Frames](./frames.md) to attach to existing inventories/tanks, rather than separate logistic chests.
