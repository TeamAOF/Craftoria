# Logistics Configurator

The *Logistics Configurator's* primary purpose is to help out with configuring a [Logistics System](./overview.md).

By *right-clicking* it on any [Logistic Frame](./frames.md) it can configure various filters.

*Sneak right-clicking* removes the frame from the inventory it's attached to.
