# Solar Compressor

The *Solar Compressor* generates [compressed air](../pressure.md) and [heat](../heat.md) from *sunlight*. To function, it requires a clear view of direct sunlight. This means it is unable to function inside, during the night, or during storms.

Crafting a *Solar Compressor*.

<Recipe id="pneumaticcraft:solar_compressor" />

While the *Solar Compressor* generates compressed air, it also generates heat proportional to how much compressed air is generated. Proper heat management is necessary to reach the full potential of the *Solar Compressor*: too little heat and the compressor will barely generate any compressed air, too much heat and the compressor with overheat and breakdown, requiring manual repairs with [Solar Cells](../solar_cell.md).

[Heat Sinks](../heat_sink.md), [Heat Pipes](../heat_pipe.md), and [Air Grates Modules](../air_grate_module.md) are the best tools to manage and remove the heat generated by the *Solar Compressor*. [Vortex Tubes](../vortex_tube.md) are also useful for heat management, as they can be used to generate additional heat to reach max efficiency. With the right setup, even [max speed](../upgrades.md#speed) *Solar Compressors* can reach a heat equilibrium at max efficiency.

The compressor has built-in thermal padding that activates whenever it is unable to generate compressed air, preventing it from gaining or losing any heat while inactive.

The compressor reaches max efficiency at *350°C*, and overheats at *425°C*.
