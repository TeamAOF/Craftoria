# Advanced Liquid Compressor

The *Advanced Liquid Compressor* is the [tier 2](../base_concepts/pressure_tiers.md) version of the [Liquid Compressor](./liquid_compressor.md), with a maximum safe pressure of 20 bar. It generates a base 50mL air/tick, and can be upgraded with [Speed Upgrades](../base_concepts/upgrades.md#speed).

However, this generator must be [cooled](../base_concepts/heat.md), as its efficiency will drop as the temperature rises, up to the point where no air is generated at all.
