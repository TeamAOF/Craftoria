# Manual Compressor

The *Manual Compressor* is an early game compressor which produces [compressed air](../base_concepts/pressure.md) from manual labor and hunger. Hold right click on the compressor to pump in air and compress it. The higher the pressure of the compressor, the longer each pump takes, until it becomes impossible to pump in more air.
