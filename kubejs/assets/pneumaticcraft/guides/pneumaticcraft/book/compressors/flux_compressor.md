# Flux Compressor

The *Flux Compressor* converts *Forge Energy* (compatible with *Redstone Flux* and the energy systems of various other mods) into [compressed air](../base_concepts/pressure.md). It consumes a base 40 FE/tick, but can be upgraded with [Speed Upgrades](../base_concepts/upgrades.md#speed).

The Flux Compressor has a capacity of 100,000 FE and accepts FE at double the rate it uses it.

Crafting a *Flux Compressor*

This generator must be [cooled](../base_concepts/heat.md), as its efficiency will drop as the temperature rises, up to the point where no air is generated at all.
