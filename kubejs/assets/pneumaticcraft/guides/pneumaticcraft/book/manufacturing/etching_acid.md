# Etching Acid

Etching Acid is used to chemically develop [PCB's](../components/pcb.md). Etching Acid is made in a [Pressure Chamber](./pressure_chamber.md) and used in the [Etching Tank](./etching_tank.md).

See the [PCB's](../components/pcb.md) entry for more info on PCB production.

**TODO:** Unsupported Patchouli page type **pneumaticcraft:pressure_chamber**
