# Fluid Mixer

A *Fluid Mixer* uses [pressure](../base_concepts/pressure.md) to combine two fluids into a resulting fluid and/or item. Its primary use is in [Biodiesel](../renewables/biodiesel.md) production.

The Fluid Mixer will run faster if more pressure is provided (but will also use air faster).
