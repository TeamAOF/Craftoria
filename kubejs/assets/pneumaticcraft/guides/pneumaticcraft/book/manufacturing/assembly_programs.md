# Assembly Programs

*Assembly Programs* must be inserted into the [Assembly Controller](./assembly_system.md) to tell it what kind of operation needs to be carried out. They cannot be crafted, but must instead be traded for; either from *Mechanic Villagers*, or via the [Amadron Tablet](../tools/amadron_tablet.md).

## Drill & Laser

<ItemImage id="pneumaticcraft:assembly_program_drill_laser" />

The *Assembly Program: Drill & Laser* is a little special. It doesn't handle both drill and laser recipes; instead, it provides a single-program method for two-step recipes which involve drilling *and* lasering steps, e.g. [Advanced Pressure Tubes](../tubes/pressure_tubes.md#advanced).
