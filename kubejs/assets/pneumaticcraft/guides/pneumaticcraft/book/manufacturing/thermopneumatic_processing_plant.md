# Thermopneumatic Plant

A *Thermopneumatic Processing Plant* uses [pressure](../base_concepts/pressure.md) and/or [heat](../base_concepts/heat.md) to process materials. It has several uses:
- 100mB *LPG* and 1 piece of *Coal* makes 1000mB of [Plastic](../components/plastic.md). This requires heat, but no pressure.
- 1000mB of *Diesel* and 1 piece of *Redstone Dust* makes 1000mB of [Lubricant](../components/lubricant.md). Again, this requires heat, but no pressure.


- The *Thermopneumatic Processing Plant* can be used to crack heavier fuels produced by a [Refinery](./refinery.md) into lighter fuels at an 80% return rate:
- Diesel -> Kerosene
- Kerosene -> Gasoline
- Gasoline -> LPG

This requires both heat and pressure.
