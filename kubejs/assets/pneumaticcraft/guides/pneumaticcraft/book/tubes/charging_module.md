# Charging Module

This tube module allow you to charge (or discharge) pressurizable items in the inventory that it faces, e.g. a chest with your pneumatic tools, or [Air Canisters](../components/air_canister.md) for long-distance air transfer (perhaps through some kind of Ender inventory system).

You can also point this module at an [Aerial Interface](../machines/aerial_interface.md) to charge items in your own player inventory.

Applying a [Module Expansion Card](./module_expansion_card.md) to the Charging Module increases the module's charging rate from 10mL/tick (per item) to 100mL/tick (per item)
