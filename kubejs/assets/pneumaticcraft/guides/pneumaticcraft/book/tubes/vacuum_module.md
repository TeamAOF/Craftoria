# Vacuum Module

The _Vacuum Module_ does the same job as the [Vacuum Pump](../machines/vacuum_pump.md) - provide negative pressure - but in a slightly more compact way. It can be placed on a vertical tube, unlike the full-size pump, which can be only be oriented horizontally.

The advantage is compactness; the disadvantage is more limited upgradeability in terms of speed and volume.

## Placement

The Vacuum Module is an _inline_ module. Place it on the end of the tube which should be the vacuum side. Providing a minimum of 2 bar pressure to the wide/green end of the tube will cause the module to spin, removing air from any tubes past the narrow/red end.

Applying a <Color id="red">redstone signal</Color> prevents the module running.

A [Module Expansion Card](./module_expansion_card.md) boosts the module's speed, roughly equivalent to adding 4 [Speed Upgrades](../base_concepts/upgrades.md#speed) to a Vacuum Pump. Similar to adding Speed Upgrades, this comes with a reduction in efficiency in terms of air usage at the positive side.
