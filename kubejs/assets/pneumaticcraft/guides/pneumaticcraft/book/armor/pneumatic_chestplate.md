# Pneumatic Chestplate

The *Pneumatic Chestplate* is one of the four *Pneumatic Armor* pieces.

It has a larger [air volume](../base_concepts/pressure.md) than the other three pieces.

Crafting a Pneumatic Chestplate

<Recipe id="pneumaticcraft:pneumatic_chestplate" />

<ItemImage id="pneumaticcraft:security_upgrade" />

With a [Security Upgrade](../base_concepts/upgrades.md#security) installed, the chestplate grants you protection from fire and lava, at a significant air cost: air is rapidly dumped from the chestplate to extinguish nearby flames and keep you cool.  It will even slowly solidify nearby lava.

## Security Upgrade (cont)

Note: this protection activates if you are about to take fire damage, so if you are already protected (e.g. via a potion), this upgrade won't do anything.

## Immersive Engineering

<ItemImage id="immersiveengineering:wirecoil_copper" />

The *Security Upgrade* will also provide protection from uninsulated [Immersive Engineering](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/immersive-engineering) wiring; you will not be injured by electric shocks from such wires, but this does cost air from the chestplate, proportional to the damage negated. This doesn't prevent any knockbacks.

<ItemImage id="pneumaticcraft:magnet_upgrade" />

With one or more [Magnet Upgrades](../base_concepts/upgrades.md#magnet) installed, nearby items and XP orbs will be attracted to you for a very small air cost.  The base range is 5 blocks, but this can be increased up to 10 blocks by adding extra upgrades.

## Magnet Upgrade (cont.)

The Magnet Upgrade respects Botania's *Solegnolia* flower, and will also not attempt to pull items from Immersive Engineering *conveyor belts*.

<ItemImage id="pneumaticcraft:charging_upgrade" />

With one or more [Charging Upgrades](../base_concepts/upgrades.md#charging) installed, the chestplate gains the ability to pressurize any other pneumatic item in your inventory, both worn and carried.  The chestplate will only charge items up to its own pressure level.  Adding extra Charging Upgrades (up to 6) increases the charging rate.

<ItemImage id="pneumaticcraft:dispenser_upgrade" />

A [Dispenser Upgrade](../base_concepts/upgrades.md#dispenser) allows items/blocks to be launched from your offhand slot by pressing & releasing *$(k:pneumaticcraft.chestplate.launcher)$(/k:pneumaticcraft.chestplate.launcher)*, similar to an [Air Cannon](../machines/air_cannon.md). It takes 15 ticks (0.75 seconds) to fully charge the launcher; releasing the key sooner will launch at reduced velocity.

## Dispenser Upgrade (cont.)


- Some blocks have special *Dispenser*-like behaviour, such as *TNT*, or *Arrows*...
- Other blocks (like *Torches*) will be fired as 'tumbling' blocks which reform as blocks when they hit something.
- Other items will simply be fired as item entities.

<ItemImage id="pneumaticcraft:range_upgrade" />

A [Range Upgrade](../base_concepts/upgrades.md#range) installed in your chestplate increases your reach distance for block interactions (not melee attacks) by 3.5 blocks while it's active. This does come with a small ongoing air cost, however.

## A/C Upgrade

<ItemImage id="pneumaticcraft:air_conditioning_upgrade" />

With up to four [Air Conditioning Upgrades](../base_concepts/upgrades.md#air_conditioning) installed, you will gain some protection from environmental temperature extremes added by the [Tough As Nails](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tough-as-nails) mod. Air Conditioning will automatically engage if it detects that your body temperature is higher or lower than normal, and disengage when equilibrium has been restored.

## A/C Upgrade (cont.)

This does come at a moderate pressure cost, however, which is dependent on the level of heating or cooling required and the number of upgrades installed. Depending on the environment you're working in, you may not need the full four upgrades to remain comfortable.
