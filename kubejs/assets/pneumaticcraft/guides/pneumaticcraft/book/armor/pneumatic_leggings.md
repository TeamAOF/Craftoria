# Pneumatic Leggings

The *Pneumatic Leggings* is one of the four *Pneumatic Armor* pieces.

Crafting a Pneumatic Leggings

<Recipe id="pneumaticcraft:pneumatic_leggings" />

<ItemImage id="pneumaticcraft:speed_upgrade" />

In addition to reducing the armor's initialization time, [Speed Upgrades](../base_concepts/upgrades.md#speed) in the leggings have a more important effect: they increase your *run speed*, at a very minor [air cost](../base_concepts/pressure.md).  Up to 4 Speed Upgrades can be installed.

## Speed Upgrade (cont.)

The armor GUI allows the speed boost to be reduced on-the-fly, if you want to change your speed without needing to find a [Charging Station](../machines/charging_station.md) to swap out upgrades.

<ItemImage id="pneumaticcraft:jumping_upgrade_1" />

A [Jumping Upgrade](../base_concepts/upgrades.md#jumping_1) provides you with increased jumping ability at a minor air cost. There are 4 tiers of Jumping Upgrade.

Holding *$(k:key.sneak)$(/k:key.sneak)* while jumping will reduce the jump height to the equivalent of a single upgrade.

## Jumping Upgrade (cont.)
