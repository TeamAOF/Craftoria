# Pneumatic Boots

The *Pneumatic Boots* is one of the four *Pneumatic Armor* pieces.

The boots provide inbuilt fall protection at a modest air cost (proportional to the fall damage negated).

You also get 1-block step assist for free (no air cost).  Note that this is step assist, not auto-jump, and it's a toggleable feature.

Crafting a Pneumatic Boots

<Recipe id="pneumaticcraft:pneumatic_boots" />

<ItemImage id="pneumaticcraft:jet_boots_upgrade_1" />

If you've ever wanted to soar through the air without a care in the world (except how much pressure you have left), the [Jet Boots Upgrade](../upgrades.md#jet_boots_1) is for you.  There are 5 tiers of Jet Boots Upgrade for progressively faster flight, and greater air usage.

## Jet Boots (cont.)

When the upgrade is active, simply hold the $(k:pneumaticcraft.boots.jet_boots) key to thrust in the direction you're looking.

*Jet Boots*$(/k:pneumaticcraft.boots.jet_boots) are a **heavy** user of air; it's strongly recommended to add multiple [Volume Upgrades](../upgrades.md#volume) to your boots (and [chestplate](./pneumatic_chestplate.md), with [Charging Upgrades](../upgrades.md#charging)).

Use of an [Aerial Interface](../aerial_interface.md) is also advised when possible, along with a good charging infrastructure at your base.

## Jet Boots (cont.)

With [Jet Boots Upgrades: Tier III](../upgrades.md#jet_boots_3) or better, you will also have access to *Builder Mode*, which allows for more creative-style (but slower) flight control and improved airborne digging speed.

This can be toggled on & off via the armor GUI (and bound to a toggle key).

## Jet Boots (cont.)

With [Jet Boots Upgrades: Tier IV](../upgrades.md#jet_boots_4) or better, you also get access to *Flight Stabilizers*, which will bring you to an immediate halt when you release the thrust key (at an air cost proportional to the speed you were travelling at).

Like Builder Mode, this too can be toggled on & off via the armor GUI (and bound to a toggle key).

<ItemImage id="pneumaticcraft:dispenser_upgrade" />

By adding up to 4 [Dispenser Upgrades](../upgrades.md#dispenser) to the boots, you gain the ability to execute a **pneumatic kick**.  This will do moderate damage to entities (and not just living entities!), but also inflict heavy knockback, at a modest air cost.

Press *$(k:pneumaticcraft.boots.kick)$(/k:pneumaticcraft.boots.kick)* to kick.

<ItemImage id="pneumaticcraft:flippers_upgrade" />

With a [Flippers Upgrade](../upgrades.md#flippers) installed, you will enjoy a moderate benefit to your swim speed. This has no extra air cost, so is a much cheaper alternative to the Jet Boots when in the water.

<ItemImage id="pneumaticcraft:stomp_upgrade" />

With a [Stomp Upgrade](../upgrades.md#stomp) installed and active, you can rain destruction down on your foes. If you hit the ground fast enough to take damage (even if that damage is absorbed by your boots), nearby mobs will be injured, proportionally to how fast you arrived. This uses up some air for each mob that was injured thus.
