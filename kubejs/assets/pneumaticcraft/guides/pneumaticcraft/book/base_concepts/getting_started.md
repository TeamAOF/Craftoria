# Getting Started

Welcome to PneumaticCraft!

- Get some _Iron_ and some _Stone_. You'll want around a stack of each (maybe a bit less iron) to start with.
- Throw your iron on the ground, and blow it up. Yes, really.
- Collect the resulting _Compressed Iron_ (a little will be lost in the explosion).
- Make some [Pressure Tubes](../tubes/pressure_tubes.md).
- Make some [Reinforced Stone](./building_materials.md).
- Build a [Pressure Chamber](../manufacturing/pressure_chamber.md).

From here on, more sections of this manual will unlock, based on _Advancements_ you receive for progressing through <Color id="dark_green">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color>. Check back on the Advancements page for the mod for guidance on what you should be making next (you'll also get a bit of _Experience_ for unlocking some Advancements, so that's nice).
