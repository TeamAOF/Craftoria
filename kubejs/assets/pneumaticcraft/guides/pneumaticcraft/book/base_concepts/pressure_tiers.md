# Pressure Tiers

<Color id="dark_green">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color> currently has three _tiers_ for pneumatic machines:

- _Tier one_ machines are capable of nominally resisting 5 bar of pressure.
- _Tier one-point-five_ machines can resist up to 10 bar.
- _Tier two_ machines can resist up to 20 bar.

Tier 1.5 is a new "tier" added in the MC 1.18 release of <Color id="dark_green">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color>. It's an optional tier, mainly intended to access some functionality which was previously tier 2 only:

- Charging tools to 10 bar
- Obtaining a _Diamond Drill Bit_ (which allows 3x3 block breaking; this used to require a _Netherite Drill Bit_)

## Gauge Pressure

Note that _bar_ as used by <Color id="dark_green">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color> represents the pressure **above** normal atmospheric pressure, so 0 bar is unpressurized air, and -1 bar is a vacuum. This is also known as _Gauge Pressure_.
