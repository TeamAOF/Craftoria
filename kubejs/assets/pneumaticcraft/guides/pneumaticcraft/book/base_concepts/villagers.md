# Mechanic Villagers

You have heard reports of a _villager_ who stocks some interesting <Color id="dark_green">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color> components. Apparently he was involved in an accident with a [Pressure Chamber](../manufacturing/pressure_chamber.md)? Anyway, these days he prefers to hang out in his own house, which can be found in villages. Failing that, a [Charging Station](../machines/charging_station.md) may prove enticing to unemployed villagers...

_Not a fan of [Amadron](../tools/amadron_tablet.md)_.
