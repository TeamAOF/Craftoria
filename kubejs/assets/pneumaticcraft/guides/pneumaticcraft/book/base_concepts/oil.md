# Crude Oil

In <Color id="dark_green">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color>, the only world generation is _Crude Oil_. It's generated similarly to water lakes; the difference is that Oil lakes are far more likely to spawn deep underground than on the surface. Because of this, assistance from tools like a [Seismic Sensor](../tools/seismic_sensor.md) is highly recommended.

Crude Oil has two purposes: to be [refined](../manufacturing/refinery.md) into high-quality fuels which can be used in [Liquid Compressors](../compressors/liquid_compressor.md), and for making [Plastic](../components/plastic.md) and [Lubricant](../components/lubricant.md).

_Plastic_ is used in many recipes in <Color id="dark_green">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color>, and _Lubricant_ is required for making [Speed Upgrades](./upgrades.md#speed).

Once you've found some Crude Oil, you'll need to extract and transport it. The recommended <Color id="dark_green">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color> way to extract oil is with a [Gas Lift](../machines/gas_lift.md), although fluid pumps from other mods can also be used. If you're pumping far from your base, one early game solution for transport is a simple [Small Tank](../machines/tanks.md), which can hold up to 32,000mB of fluid and keeps its contents when broken. (Even the Gas Lift can be used for this purpose since it also keeps its fluid contents).

## Mod Integration

<Color id="dark_green">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color> is of course not the only mod to add _Oil_; several other mods do too (including _BuildCraft_ and _Immersive Petroleum_).

Depending on your worldgen settings, <Color id="dark_green">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color> Oil might not be available; however, the [Refinery](../manufacturing/refinery.md) is capable of handling the "oil" fluid from other mods.
