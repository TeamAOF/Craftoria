# Upgrades

*Upgrades* are craftable items which can be inserted into machines and some tools to enhance their functionality in some way. To add upgrades to tools, you will need a [Charging Station](../machines/charging_station.md).

The precise effect of each upgrade varies by device; it's documented in the machine's GUI, or (for items) in the Charging Station's upgrade GUI.
