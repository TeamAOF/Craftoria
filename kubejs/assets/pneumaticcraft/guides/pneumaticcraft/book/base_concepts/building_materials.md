# Building Materials

<Color hex="#228">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color> adds a collection of *Reinforced Stone* block types, which are made with some *Stone* and a little *Compressed Iron*. Many crafting recipes require some form of Reinforced Stone.

Reinforced Stone blocks are also very suitable for building with, and all types have a high blast resistance.

In addition, *Compressed Stone*, and its various products, may be useful for aesthetic purposes. Like *Reinforced Stone*, it has excellent blast resistance.
