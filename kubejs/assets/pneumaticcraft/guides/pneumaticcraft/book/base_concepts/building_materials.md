# Building Materials

<Color id="dark_green">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color> adds a collection of _Reinforced Stone_ block types, which are made with some _Stone_ and a little _Compressed Iron_. Many crafting recipes require some form of Reinforced Stone.

Reinforced Stone blocks are also very suitable for building with, and all types have a high blast resistance.

In addition, _Compressed Stone_, and its various products, may be useful for aesthetic purposes. Like _Reinforced Stone_, it has excellent blast resistance.
