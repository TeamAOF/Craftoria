# Spawner Extractor

A *Spawner Extractor* is one of the two ways to obtain a [Spawner Core](./spawner_core.md), which you'll need if you want to use a [Pressurized Spawner](./pressurized_spawner.md).

To use the Spawner Extractor, place it on top of a vanilla *Spawner*, which you'll need to find in the world somewhere.

Then, provide the Spawner Extractor with *-0.5 bar* of vacuum or lower, and prepare for a fight. It turns out that Spawners *really* don't like being extracted, and spawn mobs at a greatly increased rate to defend themselves. Some useful tips:
- The base extraction time is about 60 seconds.
- However, any nearby defending mobs will slow the extraction down, and too many will stall extraction.


- There must be at least one player nearby or extraction will stall.
- If the *Spawner* isn't able to spawn defenders (e.g. bad light levels, ground missing...), the process will also slow down and eventually stall.

Once extraction is complete, a *Spawner Core* is ejected, and the Spawner becomes an *Empty Spawner*. This block can (and should) be picked up, since it's used to craft a [Pressurized Spawner](./pressurized_spawner.md).
