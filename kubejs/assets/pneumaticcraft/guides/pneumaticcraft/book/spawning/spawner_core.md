# Spawner Core

*Spawner Cores* are the beating heart of vanilla *Spawners*, which contain the essence of the mob to be spawned.

They can be forcibly extracted from a Spawner with a [Spawner Extractor](./spawner_extractor.md), but it's also possible to make these, and use them in the more powerful [Pressurized Spawner](./pressurized_spawner.md).

<ItemImage id="pneumaticcraft:spawner_core" />

There are two ways to obtain a Spawner Core:
- Forcibly extract one from a Spawner with a [Spawner Extractor](./spawner_extractor.md) (be ready for a fight!) Such cores are 100% filled with essence of that Spawner's mob.
- Craft your own Spawner Core and use a [Vacuum Trap](./vacuum_trap.md) to capture mob essence to fill it.

Note that it's possible for a Spawner Core filled by a *Vacuum Trap* to contain the essence of several different mobs, which may or may not be desirable.

You can release a random mob from the core by *right-clicking* it, but this can be a bit of a hit and miss affair. Producing a core with 100% purity via *Vacuum Trap* isn't trivial, and takes some care.

Crafting a Spawner Core Shell. Used in crafting an actual *Spawner Core*.
