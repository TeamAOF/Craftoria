# Seismic Sensor

A Seismic Sensor is an early game item used to track down [Oil](../base_concepts/oil.md). Unlike most tools, the sensor does not require [pressure](../base_concepts/pressure.md) to operate. When _right-clicked_, it will show whether or not Oil was found somewhere directly below the block the sensor was clicked on.

A Seismic Sensor can have two results:

<Color id='blue'> No Oil found.</Color>

No Oil is found right under this block. Keep looking.

<Color id='blue'> Found Oil \<distance\>m below. It contains about \<amount\> buckets of Oil.</Color>

Oil is found! The clicked block would be a suitable place to put a [Gas Lift](../machines/gas_lift.md) to pump the Oil out.
