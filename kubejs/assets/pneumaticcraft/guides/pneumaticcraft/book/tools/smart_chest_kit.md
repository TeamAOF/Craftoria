# Smart Chest Upgrade Kit

The *Smart Chest Upgrade Kit* is a convenience which lets you upgrade any wooden chest or [Reinforced Chest](../machines/reinforced_chest.md) to a [Smart Chest](../machines/smart_chest.md) in-place, keeping the chest's items. Just *Sneak-Right-click* the upgrade kit against any valid chest to upgrade it.



Note: If used on a *Reinforced Chest*, you will get back a Reinforced Chest as an item drop. If used on a *wooden chest*, you will get that chest back as an item drop.

Crafting a Smart Chest Upgrade Kit.

Note that the Smart Chest must be completely empty and unconfigured.
