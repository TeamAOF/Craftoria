# Minigun

The _Minigun_ is a handheld weapon, which runs on [compressed air](../base_concepts/pressure.md) and [Gun Ammo](./minigun_ammo.md). Ammo needs to be inserted into the [Minigun's magazine](./minigun_ammo.md#magazine) - it will not be consumed from the player's inventory.

To fire the minigun, simply hold _right-click_. The barrel will start to spin and will fire as soon as it is up to speed.

## Upgrading

Many features (spin-up speed, range, potion proc chance...) of the _Minigun_ are upgradable in a [Charging Station](../machines/charging_station.md).

Full documentation on each upgrade and its effects is available in the Charging Station's upgrade GUI.
