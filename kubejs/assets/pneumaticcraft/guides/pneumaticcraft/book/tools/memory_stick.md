# Memory Stick

A *Memory Stick* is a useful handheld device for extracting, storing, and restoring player experience levels:
- *Right-click*: move one level of experience from yourself into the stick
- *Sneak + Right-click*: move one level of experience from the stick to yourself
- *Left-click*: toggle XP auto-absorption, where any XP orbs you collect are automatically absorbed by the stick

Experience stored in the Memory Stick can also be extracted as [Memory Essence](../base_concepts/memory_essence.md) fluid. To do this, simply *right-click* any [Fluid Tank](../machines/tanks.md) to transfer XP to or from the tank (other mods' fluid tanks should also work fine here). Right-clicking an empty tank will attempt to transfer Memory Essence from the stick to the tank; right-clicking a tank with any Memory Essence will attempt to transfer from the tank to the stick.

## Curios

With the *Curios* mod installed, you can store the Memory Stick in any Curios slot, to save on inventory space. This is particularly useful with XP auto-absorption switched on.
