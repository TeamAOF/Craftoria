# GPS Tool

The _GPS Tool_ is an item that when _right-clicked_ on a block, saves the block's coordinate. This data is used in several places in <Color id="dark_green">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color>; see overleaf.

_Right-clicking_ the _GPS Tool_ in the air opens a GUI allowing coordinates to be adjusted directly.

Sneaking and scrolling the mouse wheel allows quick adjustment of the coordinate along the player's facing axis.

## Linking Global Variables

[Global Variables](../programming/variables.md#global) are an advanced [Drone](../base_concepts/drone.md) feature, accessed via the [Coordinate Operator](../programming/coordinate_operator.md).

_Right-clicking_ a _GPS Tool_ in the air allows a variable name to be entered.

Now, that _Global Variable_ will track the value of the _GPS Tool's_ selected coordinate. This can be used to make _Drone programs_ that use dynamic areas.
