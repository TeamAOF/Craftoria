# Camouflage Applicator

The _Camouflage Applicator_ can be used to camouflage certain <Color id="dark_green">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color> blocks:

- [Pressure Tubes](../tubes/pressure_tubes.md)
- [Pneumatic Door Base](../machines/pneumatic_door.md)
- [Elevator Base & Caller](../machines/elevators.md)
- [Charging Station](../machines/charging_station.md)
- [Heat Pipe](../machines/heat_pipe.md)

_Right-click_ any solid block to copy its appearance to the Applicator tool, or _sneak+right-click_ to clear the copied block.

Then, _right-click_ any camouflageable block (see above) to apply or remove camouflage.

You'll need an actual block in your inventory to apply it as camouflage, which gets used (but you get it back when you remove the camouflage).

You can also uncamouflage a camouflaged block by breaking it with a pick or other suitable tool; the camouflage will be broken off instead.
