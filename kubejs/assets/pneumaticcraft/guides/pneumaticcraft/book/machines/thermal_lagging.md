# Thermal Lagging

As you're probably aware, <Color id="dark_green">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color> machines which use [Heat](../base_concepts/heat.md) will lose heat to the air, if left exposed. While you can cover these machines with pretty much any non-air, non-heat-conducting block, _Thermal Lagging_ is particularly suitable for insulating machines.

_Thermal Lagging_ has the useful property of allowing you to _click through_ to the block behind, as if the lagging wasn't even present.

This applies unless you are holding any type of _Pickaxe_, _wrench_, or you are _sneaking_, which lets you target the lagging itself for removal or other interaction.
