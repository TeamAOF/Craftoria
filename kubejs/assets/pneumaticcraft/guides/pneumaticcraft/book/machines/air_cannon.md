# Air Cannon

The _Air Cannon_ is a device you can use to transport items quite some distance, through the air. It uses [compressed air](../base_concepts/pressure.md) as propellant.

You will also need a [GPS Tool](../tools/gps_tool.md) to aim the _Air Cannon_ (although the GPS Tool can be removed and re-used once the Cannon is aimed).

A <Color id="red">redstone pulse</Color> will trigger the Cannon to fire.

## Upgrades

With a [Dispenser Upgrade](../base_concepts/upgrades.md#dispenser) installed, the _Air Cannon_ behaves like a vanilla _Dispenser_ for certain items, e.g. TNT or Fire Charges.

With an [Entity Tracker Upgrade](../base_concepts/upgrades.md#entity_tracker), the _Air Cannon_ will not launch items from its inventory, but instead launch the nearest entity (including you!) when triggered.
