# Pneumatic Dynamo

The *Pneumatic Dynamo* converts [compressed air](../base_concepts/pressure.md) into *Forge Energy*, which is compatible with *Redstone Flux* and other mods' energy systems. It produces 40 FE/tick by default, but can be upgraded with [Speed Upgrades](../base_concepts/upgrades.md#speed). The FE output rate of the *Flux Compressor* is twice the amount of the current FE production; 80 FE/tick by default, but can be increased via Speed Upgrades.

An important factor that influences efficiency is the Dynamo's [temperature](../base_concepts/heat.md). The Dynamo needs to be *cooled*, or its efficiency will drop as the temperature rises, up to the point where no air is generated at all.
