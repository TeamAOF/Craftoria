# Display Table

The _Display Table_ is a simple inventory which can store (and display) a single item. It's partly intended for decorative purposes, but may also be useful for automation, since the table's inventory can be interacted with via hoppers, drones & other piping systems.

Display Tables, when placed next to each other, will visually connect and not render adjacent legs, forming a single larger table. This does require that both blocks have exactly the same rotation; if the rotation is different, then the table will not connect in this way.

Visually-connected tables still have a separate 1-item inventory for each table.
