# Heat Pipe

The *Heat Pipe* is an insulated core of compressed iron which can transmit heat between blocks, without any thermal connection to adjacent air or fluid blocks. It's a more compact (and cheaper) alternative to using *Compressed Iron Blocks* to transmit heat.

You can conceal Heat Pipes with the [Camouflage Applicator](../camo_applicator.md).
