# Heat Frame

This item can be placed on any *inventory*. When heated by an adjacent [Heat source](../heat.md) it will try to smelt any item in the inventory (or freeze it when cooled). It will only succeed if there is room in the inventory for the resulting item. The more heat applied, the faster the smelting process will be, up to a maximum of 1 item per second. Similarly, the more it's cooled, the faster it will freeze objects.

## CraftTweaker

The *Heat Frame* has [CraftTweaker](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/crafttweaker) support for cooling (smelting just uses regular *Furnace* recipes): recipes can be added and removed. Follow the link below for more information.
