# Crop Support

When placed on farmland with a *crop*, this will improve the growth speed of that crop. *Green particles* are emitted to show when the *Crop Support* speeds up the growth.

To remove a *Crop Support*, either break the block underneath it or *sneak-right-click* the block with a [Logistics Configurator](../tools/logistics_configurator.md) or another *Crop Support*.
