# Transfer Gadget

The _Transfer Gadget_ is a rather basic item/fluid transfer item. It can be placed _between_ two inventories or tanks to transfer between them. The best way to place it is to first place down one inventory, then right click the side of that block with a _Transfer Gadget_, then place the second inventory.

The Transfer Gadget will have one of two colors:

- <Color id="gold">Orange</Color> - output mode
- <Color id="dark_red">Blue</Color> - input mode.

An <Color id="gold">output mode</Color> gadget extracts from the inventory/tank it's placed on, inserting to the neighbouring block, and an <Color id="dark_red">input mode</Color> gadget does the opposite. Resources are transferred at a rate of 1 item or 100mB fluid every 2 seconds.

_Right-click_ the _Transfer Gadget_ with an empty hand or a [Logistics Configurator](../tools/logistics_configurator.md) to toggle input/output mode. _Sneak+right-click_ (or left-click - hit) to remove the _Transfer Gadget_.

Because of its low speed and cheap recipe, this is ideal for early-game item/fluid transfer where space might be limited.
