# Upgrade Matrix

The *Upgrade Matrix* can be used in place of *Lapis Lazuli* for the crafting of any [upgrades](../base_concepts/upgrades.md). The advantage of using Upgrade Matrices is greatly decreased Lapis usage, which may be a boon if you have limited Lapis and many upgrades to craft.

**TODO:** Unsupported Patchouli page type **pneumaticcraft:thermo_plant**
