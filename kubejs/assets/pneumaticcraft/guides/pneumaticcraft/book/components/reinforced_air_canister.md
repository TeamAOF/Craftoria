# Reinforced Air Canister

Like its little brother the [Air Canister](./air_canister.md), the *Reinforced Air Canister* holds air and can be charged and discharged in a [Charging Station](../machines/charging_station.md). However, it has an increased volume of 6000mL and can be charged to 20 bar (it won't explode).

An interesting use for the *Reinforced Air Canister* is as a bulk air storage device, in conjunction with an inventory such as a chest and a [Pressure Tube](../tubes/pressure_tubes.md) with a [Charging Module](../tubes/charging_module.md). This can get even more interesting with an [Aerial Interface](../machines/aerial_interface.md) and a (vanilla) *Ender Chest*...
