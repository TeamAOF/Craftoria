# Air Canister

The *Air Canister* is a crafting component for any [pressurizable](../base_concepts/pressure.md) item or tool. It can also be charged and discharged in a [Charging Station](../machines/charging_station.md). The *Air Canister* has a volume of 3000mL and can be charged to 10 bar (it won't explode).

Any pneumatic items crafted with an *Air Canister* will retain the canister's air.
