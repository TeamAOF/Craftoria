# Nuke Virus

This is a special component, only used when trying to hack [Security Stations](../machines/security_station.md). It is not craftable and can only be found in dungeon loot, or (rarely) as a villager trade.

Applying a *Nuke Virus* to a node while hacking will nuke the node, hacking it instantly. Note that the Nuke Virus has a 3-second cooldown between repeated uses.
