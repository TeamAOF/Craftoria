# STOP! Worm

This is a special component, only used when trying to hack [Security Stations](../machines/security_station.md). It is not craftable and can only be found in dungeon loot, or (rarely) as a villager trade.

Applying a *STOP! Worm* while hacking will temporarily freeze the station's [Diagnostic Subroutine](./network_components.md#diagnostic) from tracing you.
