# Ethanol

*Ethanol* can be produced in a [Thermopneumatic Processing Plant](../manufacturing/thermopneumatic_processing_plant.md) with [Yeast Culture](./yeast_culture.md) and *Sugar*. It is one of the constituents of [Biodiesel](./biodiesel.md).

This process is temperature-sensitive: you will need to keep the Thermopneumatic Processing Plant's temperature between 30°C and 60°C.

This is very easy in warmer biomes but may take a little effort in cooler areas - one thing to note is that the ambient temperature tend to rise as you dig deeper, so temperate biomes might be suitable if do your processing at a lower Y-level.
