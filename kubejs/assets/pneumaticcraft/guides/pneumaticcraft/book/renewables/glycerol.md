# Glycerol

*Glycerol* is a by-product of producing [Biodiesel](./biodiesel.md), but it turns out to be a rather useful substance in its own right. Its uses are detailed in the following pages.

*Bandages* can be used to quickly heal 3 hearts of health. Quickly is not instantaneous, though; you will need to right-click and hold for 2 seconds to apply a bandage, and there is an 8-second cooldown between uses.

Double the output of using *Sugar*, what's not to like? This will save on your precious [Lubricant](../components/lubricant.md).

## As a Fuel

*Glycerol* also makes a decent fuel item, equivalent to 4 *Planks* or half a lump of *Coal*.
