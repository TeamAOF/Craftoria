# Vegetable Oil

*Vegetable Oil* can be produced in a [Thermopneumatic Processing Plant](../manufacturing/thermopneumatic_processing_plant.md) from various *seeds* and *crops*. Seeds tend to be a better source of oil than grown crops. Vegetable Oil is required in the production of [Biodiesel](./biodiesel.md).
