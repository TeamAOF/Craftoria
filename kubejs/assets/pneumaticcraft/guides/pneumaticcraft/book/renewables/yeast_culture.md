# Yeast Culture

*Yeast Culture* is required for the production of [Ethanol](./ethanol.md) as well as [Sourdough](./sourdough.md) and can be produced in a couple of ways:

## Method 1

<ItemImage id="minecraft:red_mushroom" />

This will be the only method available to you initially. Fill a [Thermopneumatic Processing Plant](../manufacturing/thermopneumatic_processing_plant.md) with *Water*, and add some mushrooms. This method is a little slow (and will require a good supply of mushrooms), but will easily produce an initial stock of Yeast Culture.

## Method 1 (cont.)

This process is temperature-sensitive: you will need to keep the Thermopneumatic Processing Plant's temperature between 30°C and 60°C. This is very easy in warmer biomes but may take a little effort in cooler areas - one thing to note is that the ambient temperature tend to rise as you dig deeper, so temperate biomes might be suitable if do your processing at a lower Y-level.

## Important Note

*In-world Yeast Crafting as described in the following pages has been disabled in this instance's configuration.*

## Method 2

*Yeast Culture*, being a living organism, is capable of replicating itself. To do this, pour a bucket of the culture into a pool in-world, and throw some *Sugar* into the pool.

Now, pour a bucket of *Water* into a block space adjacent to the culture; you will see the water be converted into more culture after a second or two.

## Method 2 (cont.)

It's important to note that the culture will spread when water is placed, not when sugar is added.

This method can be automated with a little thought and design, even early in the game (hint: [Omnidirectional](../machines/omnidirectional_hopper.md) and [Liquid](../machines/liquid_hopper.md) Hoppers with [Dispenser Upgrades](../base_concepts/upgrades.md#dispenser) may be very helpful).
