# Biodiesel

*Biodiesel* can be produced in a [Fluid Mixer](../manufacturing/fluid_mixer.md) with [Ethanol](./ethanol.md) and [Vegetable Oil](./vegetable_oil.md). It's just as good a fuel as regular *Diesel*, but has the advantage of being renewably-produced.

Biodiesel can also be used to make [Plastic](../components/plastic.md) and [Lubricant](../components/lubricant.md) in a *Thermopneumatic Processing Plant*.

Fuel from food? What's not to like?
