# Biodiesel Overview

This is a very quick guide to producing renewable *Biodiesel*. Follow the steps here, and refer to other pages in this section for more detail on specific topics (other pages may be advancement-locked, but will unlock as you complete the prerequisite steps).

Step 1a: Make some *Yeast Culture*: get some mushrooms and water, and combine them in a [Thermopneumatic Processing Plant](../manufacturing/thermopneumatic_processing_plant.md). You will need to ensure the TPP has temperature of between 30°C and 60°C, which may be easy or tricky depending on your biome and altitude.

Step 1b (optional): Once you have least one bucket of Yeast Culture, you can produce more in a faster way by pouring it into a pool in-world, dropping some sugar into the pool, and pouring a bucket of water into a blockspace adjacent to the culture; the culture will replicate itself into the water you poured out.

Step 2: Make some *Ethanol* by adding your *Yeast Culture* and some *Sugar* to a [Thermopneumatic Processing Plant](../manufacturing/thermopneumatic_processing_plant.md). This is temperature-dependent in a very similar way to step 1a.

Step 3: Make some *Vegetable Oil* by squeezing *seeds* or *crops* in a [Thermopneumatic Processing Plant](../manufacturing/thermopneumatic_processing_plant.md) with a little pressure.

Step 4: Combine your *Ethanol* and *Vegetable Oil* in a [Fluid Mixer](../manufacturing/fluid_mixer.md). Congratulations, you have made some renewable fuel!
