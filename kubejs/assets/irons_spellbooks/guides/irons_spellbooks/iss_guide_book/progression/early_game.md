# Early Game

## Overview

Early game progression is dominated by exploring and looting. The world is full of magic loot, especially in new magic structures that can be found dotted across the lands. But be careful! Each magic structure is home to a powerful mage, who will not take kindly to you.

## Scrolls

<ItemImage id="irons_spellbooks:scroll" />

Scrolls will be your first taste of magic. While they can be consumed to cast the spell they hold, it is better to save them until you can inscribe it into a spell book, where it can be used repeatedly, via an Inscription Table >>>

## Inscription Table

In order to properly use a Spell Book, you must inscribe spells into it with the Inscription Table by using scrolls. Scrolls can be retrieved once put into a Spell Book, but it will uninscribe the spell. Beginner spell books can be crafted with basic materials.

## Basic Materials

<ItemImage id="irons_spellbooks:arcane_essence" />

Some basic materials can even be found sparsely in vanilla structures.

Arcane Essence can be combined with leather armor to craft Wandering Magician armor, an early source of additional max mana.
