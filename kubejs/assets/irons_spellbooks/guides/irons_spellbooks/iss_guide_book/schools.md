# Schools of Magic

## Overview

Each magical spell belong to a school of magic. Each school encapsulates a theme, both visually and functionally, and each have a Focus: a representative item used as a crafting ingredient. Furthermore, each school can be empowered by specific school related gear, allowing you to become a powerful master of a single school, or mix and match to become a jack of all trades.

## Eldritch

<ItemImage id="irons_spellbooks:eldritch_manuscript" />

The Eldritch school is not like the others. It is an ancient and powerful way of magic, one that has all but been forgotten; you will be unable to immediately craft or cast Eldritch spells. However, shreds of ancient Eldritch manuscripts can still be found scattered throughout the world, and may even be pieced back together with the help of an echo shard.

## Eldritch, continued

Once a manuscript has been restored, it can be consumed to learn a single Eldritch spell, enabling the crafting and casting of it. After being learned, the Echo Shard is used as the focus.
