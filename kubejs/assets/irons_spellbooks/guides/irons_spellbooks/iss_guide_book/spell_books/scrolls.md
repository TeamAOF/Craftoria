# Scrolls

## Scrolls

<ItemImage id="irons_spellbooks:scroll" />

Scrolls can be found in chests, looted from mobs, or crafted. Each Scroll contains a spell with a level, similar to an enchanted book. Scrolls can be upgraded in the Arcane Anvil by combining them with the corresponding rarity of ink of their next level.

Scrolls can be used on their own to cast their spell, subverting mana costs and cooldown, but consuming the scroll in the process. Primarily, they are inscribed into spell books for continued use, or recycled via the Alchemist Cauldron to be turned into more useful spells.
