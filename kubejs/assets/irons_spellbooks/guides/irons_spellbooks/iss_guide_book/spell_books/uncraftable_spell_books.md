# Unique Spell Books

## Unique Spell Books

Unique spell books are rare drops from certain mobs that come with spells inscribed, which cannot be removed or edited. Not every spell book can be manufactured -- it is called the arcane art, after all.

## Unique Improvements

<ItemImage id="irons_spellbooks:arcane_anvil" />

The spells in a unique spell book are locked, but can be improved. By combining a unique spell book in the Arcane Anvil with a higher-level scroll of the same spell from the spell book, you can raise the level of the locked spell.

<ItemImage id="irons_spellbooks:evoker_spell_book" />

A book full of foundational illager magick, the Grimoire of Evokation can be dropped by Evokers or their more powerful casting cousin, Archevokers.

<ItemImage id="irons_spellbooks:necronomicon_spell_book" />

An ancient book holding a host of dark spells, it can only be acquired by taking it from its undead owner.
