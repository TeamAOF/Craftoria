# Hot Water

Steam machines need steam to function, and that's exactly what the boiler provides.

It will slowly use fuel to heat up. When it's hot enough, it will start to produce steam.

## Steam Bucket

You can also smelt water buckets into steam buckets. Make your first [Bronze Compressor](steam_machines.md) before the boiler to save a lot on the plates!

## Bronze Boiler

<Recipe id="modern_industrialization:steam_age/bronze/boiler_asbl" />

It probably looks expensive to you right now, but don't forget that you can triple ores with the Forge Hammer. Also, as soon as you will have your first two machines, it will become more than twice less expensive!

## Fire Clay Dust

<Recipe id="modern_industrialization:materials/fire_clay_dust" />

To make fire clay bricks, you will need to cook fire clay dusts and in order to craft these, you will need brick dusts. To make some, place bricks in the Forge Hammer. The process efficiency can be improved in steam machines or with a Hammer.
