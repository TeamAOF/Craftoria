# Upgrading To Steel

Now that you have steel, you can upgrade your bronze machines if you want. Steel machines can process recipes up to 4 EU/t, and they will process recipes at twice the speed as long as the energy usage doesn't go above 4 EU/t. Basically, they are twice as fast as bronze machines and they may also unlock new recipes.

## Steel Upgrade

<Recipe id="modern_industrialization:steam_age/steel/steel_upgrade_asbl" />

To upgrade a bronze machine, craft a Steel Upgrade and apply it in a Crafting Table.

You can also sneak and right-click a bronze machine with the upgrade to apply it directly.

Steel hatches have more capacity than bronze hatches, and a multiblock with at least one steel hatch will be upgraded to steel tier. This means that it will go twice as fast if its energy usage wouldn't exceed 4 EU/t.

A steel boiler will produce twice as much steam as a bronze one, that means up to 16 EU/t, and a steel water pump will produce twice as much water as its bronze counterpart, so up to 2 buckets / 5 seconds.

Steel tanks store up to 16 buckets.

You can check all recipes in EMI!

## Packer and Unpacker

The Packer, a new machine only available in steel, can perform simple crafts for you. You can now automate double ingots and pipes, for example! Again, check EMI.

The Unpacker, a new machine only available in steel... Guess what it does. o_O

## Trash Can

<Recipe id="modern_industrialization:trash_can" />

With a few steel plates, you can now craft a very useful block!

The Automatic Trash Can will destroy any item or fluid that is piped into it!

Additionally, while holding the trash can over a machine's fluid tank, you can click to dump that tank into the trash can directly.
