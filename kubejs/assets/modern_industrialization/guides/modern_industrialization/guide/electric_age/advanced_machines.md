# Advanced Machines

## Aluminum

<ItemGrid>
  <ItemIcon id="aluminum_ingot" />
</ItemGrid>

Aluminum is a material used to make more advanced machines. Like the other electric machines, these new machines will only connect to LV cables. Put bauxite dust in an Electric Blast Furnace and you'll get aluminum nuggets.

## Centrifuge

<Recipe id="modern_industrialization:electric_age/machine/centrifuge_asbl"/>

The Centrifuge splits items by spinning them very fast. You can use it to make carbon dust and unlock better recipes for steel and silicon.

## Chemical Reactor

<Recipe id="modern_industrialization:electric_age/machine/chemical_reactor_asbl"/>

The Chemical Reactor can make items and fluids react.

## Distillery

<Recipe id="modern_industrialization:electric_age/machine/distillery_asbl"/>

The Distillery will turn various fluids into their lighter parts. That will be very useful for Oil Processing.

## Electrolyzer

<Recipe id="modern_industrialization:electric_age/machine/electrolyzer_asbl"/>

The Electrolyzer can split materials into their different parts using strong electric currents. You can electrolyze bauxite dust to get aluminum dust, which you can then directly smelt into aluminum ingots in the EBF.

## Configurable Tank

<Recipe id="modern_industrialization:electric_age/machine/configurable_tank_asbl"/>

The Configurable Tank is the fluid equivalent of the Configurable Chest.

It has 9 configurable slots that can each hold 16 buckets, and auto-eject functionality! Useful for automation with many different fluids!
