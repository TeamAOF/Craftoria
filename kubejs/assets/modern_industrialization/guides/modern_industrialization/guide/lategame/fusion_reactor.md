## Fusion Reactor

<Recipe id="modern_industrialization:electric_age/machine/fusion_reactor_asbl" />

The Fusion Reactor is the ultimate energy source! It can combine Deuterium, Tritium, and/or Helium-3 into Helium Plasma, the most powerful fuel in the game!. However, it requires a large amount of energy to ignite the reaction.

The Plasma Turbine can turn Helium Plasma into EU, at the rate of 100 kEU per millibucket. Its maximum production rate is roughly 1 MEU/t.
