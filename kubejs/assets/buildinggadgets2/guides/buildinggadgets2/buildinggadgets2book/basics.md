# Basics

All of the gadgets in this mod require Forge Energy (FE) to do most of their functions. 

Many mods add support for charging items with forge energy, but if you don't have any of them, theres always Charging Gadgets! Available at a mod repository near you!

A settings menu can be opened by holding the 'settings menu' key (default is 'g').  

Each gadget has different settings, so ensure you review the [Mechanics](./mechanics.md) chapter for more details!
