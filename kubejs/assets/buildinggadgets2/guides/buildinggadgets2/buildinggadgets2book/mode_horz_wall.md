# Horizontal Wall

Horizontal Wall works a few different ways. With place on top enabled, it'll build an area above the block you're looking at, or extending towards you if looking at a side. 

With place on top disabled, it'll build around the block you're looking at.

See the pictures to the right for the different options.
