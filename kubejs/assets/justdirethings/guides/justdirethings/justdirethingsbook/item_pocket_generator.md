# Pocket Generator

The Pocket Generator is a portable energy source, perfect for keeping energy-dependent tools and armor charged while on the go. Essential for adventurers relying on Forge Energy.

Open the UI by clicking it, and insert fuel in the form of coal or upgraded coals from this mod!

Higher tier fuels burn hotter and longer, so you'll get more forge energy / tick if you use higher tier fuels.  You can also use the [Fuel Canister](./item_fuel_canister.md).
