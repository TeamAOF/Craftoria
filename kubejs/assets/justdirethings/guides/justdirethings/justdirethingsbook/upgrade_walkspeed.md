# Walk Speed

Enhance your walking pace with the Walk Speed upgrade. Ideal for exploring or farming, this upgrade makes your movement more efficient without sprinting.

Can be installed on Ferricore level leggings, but higher tier leggings can allow for faster walk speeds. A slider is available in the settings screen to adjust it.
