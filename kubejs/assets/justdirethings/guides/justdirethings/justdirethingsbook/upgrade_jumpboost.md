# Jump Boost

Leap higher with the Jump Boost upgrade. This enhancement increases your jumping height, making it easier to overcome obstacles and reach elevated areas.

Can be installed on Ferricore level boots, but higher tier boots can allow for higher jumps. A slider is available in the settings screen to adjust it.
