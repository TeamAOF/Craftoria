# Invulnerability

Gain temporary invincibility with the Invulnerability upgrade. You'll need to assign a hotkey to this ability, and activate it with the hotkey.  Once done, you'll be completely immune from all damage for a short time.

Note: There is a long cooldown before you can use it again, and it uses some durability to activate.
