# Advanced Swapper

The Advanced Swapper is an upgraded version of the [Simple Swapper](./mach_blockswappert1.md).

Its main feature upgrades include area of effect and filtering entities/blocks.

When bound to another swapper, the 'Radius' settings will replicate to each other, meaning if you change the radius on one block, it'll copy to its partner.

The advanced block swapper can teleport entire houses, and their contents, from one place to another. Or it can be used to send all baby animals to another location.

Filtering using the Creature Catcher allows you to be more precise. Capture a blue sheep (or Axolotl) and specify 'compare NBT' on the filter settings. This will ensure only blue sheep get teleported. If you set it to 'deny' mode, all sheep except blue ones will be teleported.
