# Fuel Canister

The Fuel Canister is essential for storing and transporting large quantities of fuel.

Right click the item to open the UI. Insert fuel by shift clicking (or picking up the fuel and clicking it into the UI). Any fuel will work, such as coal, wood, etc, but not lava buckets.

The tooltip will tell you how much fuel you've stored. The fuel canister can then be placed into machines such as furnaces and generators, and it will consume fuel from the canister. This is a good way to ensure you don't waste a full piece of coal to smelt 1 ore!

Note: theres no way to get the items back out!

Inserting the fuel from this mod will also transfer its fuel multipler attribute, and will average it with the existing fuel in the canister. The tooltip on the canister will tell you the multiplier you'll get, if you use the canister in a [Pocket Generator](./item_pocket_generator.md) or [Generator](./mach_generatort1.md).
