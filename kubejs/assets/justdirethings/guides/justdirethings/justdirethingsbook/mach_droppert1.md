# Simple Dropper

The Simple Dropper is designed to drop items into the world.

The direction button changes the direction in which items are dropped - by default this is 'downwards' like a normal dropper. Keep in mind that it'll drop in the block space that the dropper is facing.

The number button on this screen controls the stack size thats dropped.

By default this is 1, meaning 1 item at a time will be dropped, but increasing it will mean more items will be dropped at a time.

When set to 64, it'll drop an entire stack at once.

Note: When set to 64, it doesn't NEED to have 64 items to drop, it'll just drop as many as it has.

The 'pickup delay' button on this screen controls the pickup delay applied to the items dropped.

By default in minecraft, when you drop an item on the ground, theres a short period of time before you can pick it up again. This button controls that delay for items dropped by the dropper.

The default is 0, meaning items can be picked up immediately.
