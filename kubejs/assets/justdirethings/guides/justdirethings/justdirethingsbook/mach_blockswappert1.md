# Simple Swapper

The Simple Swapper is designed to swap blocks and/or entities in the world between it and a paired partner.

Start by placing two swappers in the world. Then use a Ferricore Wrench, right click the first swapper, then the 2nd. A message will tell you that they are bound.

The UI will also have a green button showing where its bound to.

The **blocks** button lets you toggle between swapping blocks or not. When enabled, it'll swap blocks in front of the swappers with each other. When disabled, it'll ignore them.

The **entities** button matches the functionality of the  [Simple Clicker](./mach_clickert1.md) filters for entities.

When swapping blocks, block entities like chests will swap just fine.

You can use this to switch out different chests or machines, or swap two types of blocks in the world.

When targetting entities, you can use it as an early form of teleporting between two locations (target players), or catch some mobs or entities and send them elsewhere.

For example, you could place a baby animal in front of it, and set it to teleport adults only. Once the baby grows up, it'll teleport away!
