# Simple Fluid Collector

The Simple Fluid Collector automates the collection of fluids from the world. It will try to collect any fluid in front of it, and fill it's internal buffer with that fluid. Note that it can only hold 1 fluid at a time.

The item slot can be used to fill an empty bucket, or other fluid containing item like the fluid canister.
