# Refined Blaze Ember Fuel

Refined Blaze Ember Fuel is a potent source of energy. It is produced by processing Unrefined Blaze Ember Fuel, which is obtained by dropping [Blaze Ember](./res_coal_t2.md) into [Polymorphic Fluid](./res_polymorphic_fluid.md). Place this mixture beside a Blazebloom Goo block to refine it.

Refined Blaze Ember Fuel is an efficient fuel, and can be used to generate energy in the [Fuel Generator](./mach_generatorfluidt1.md).
