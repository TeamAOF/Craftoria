# Goo Basics

Goo is a transformative substance that can alter certain blocks placed adjacent to it. Each tier of goo has the capacity to consume and convert stronger blocks into new, advanced resources.

This system allows for the progressive unlocking of materials and crafting capabilities.

To utilize goo:

1. Craft a goo block and position it in your world.

2. Activate the goo by feeding it a specific resource it can consume (indicated by the goo block).

3. Place an eligible block next to the activated goo to start the transformation process.

Note: After transforming a block, there's a 10% chance the goo will need reactivation by feeding it another item. While inactive, the goo cannot initiate new transformations, but any ongoing processes will continue to completion.

Higher tier goo can always craft everything a lower tier can, and are much faster.
