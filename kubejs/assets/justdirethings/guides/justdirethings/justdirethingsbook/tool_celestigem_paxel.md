# Celestigem Paxel

The Celestigem Paxel combines the capabilities of a pickaxe, axe, and shovel. Crafted with the respective tools, it inherits their upgrades, offering versatility and extended utility.

Craft it by combining a Celestigem Pickaxe, Axe, and Shovel in a smithing table. Any installed upgrades on the tools will carry over to the paxel.
