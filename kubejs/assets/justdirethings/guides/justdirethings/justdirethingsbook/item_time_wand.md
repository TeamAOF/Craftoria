# Time Wand

The Time Wand is a portable way to take advantage of the time altering abilities of [Time Crystals](./res_time_crystal.md)

Do note, to use this wand you'll need to charge it with both Forge Energy and [Time Fluid](./res_time_fluid.md)

**TODO:** Unsupported Patchouli page type **justdirethings:text_with_config**

```
{"type":"justdirethings:text_with_config","text":"Simply right click on any block that ticks - this includes machines like Furnaces, and crops like Wheat. At first, it will cause the block to run twice as fast. Click again to double it to 4x, then 8x, all the way up to #time_wand.time_wand_max_multiplier#x speed!

Each acceleration will consume both Forge Energy and Time Fluid based on how fast the speed increase is.

This speed increase will last for 30 seconds.","config_options":["time_wand.time_wand_max_multiplier"]}
