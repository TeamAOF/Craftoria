# Mental Obliteration

The Mental Obliteration upgrade disables the artificial intelligence of the targeted mob. The mob will forever be completely brainless, taking no further action, due to a complete time lock on it's brain.

This is an activated ability, and must be bound to a hotkey in the tool settings menu.
