# Advanced Dropper

The Advanced Dropper is an upgraded version of the [Simple Dropper](./mach_droppert1.md).

Unlike most Advanced machines, you can't change the radius, but can you change the offset, meaning you can drop items further away from the dropper itself.

There is a 3x3 grid to fill with droppable items.

The filter slots at the bottom can be used to specify which items are allowed to be dropped, and more importantly, which ORDER they drop in! For example, if you put cobblestone, followed by redstone, it will drop cobblestone first, then redstone next.

If you run out of redstone, it'll stop dropping until it gets more.
