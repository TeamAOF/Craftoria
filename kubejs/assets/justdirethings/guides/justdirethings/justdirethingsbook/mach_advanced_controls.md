# Advanced Machines

Advanced machines typically have the same controls as their simple counterparts and several more.

**Area Affect**

Advanced machines can affect a large area, which can be visualized by clicking the 'Render area' button, to see in-world what area the block will affect.

Using the RAD and OFF buttons will adjust where this area affect applies.

RAD will affect the radius, increase the area being affected.

OFF will affect the block offset, moving the center of the area to a different position.

Test using these button with 'render area' active.

**Filters**

Most advanced machines have a row of filter slots, that allow you to filter what the machine affects. This might be items, blocks or entities!

You can drag from JEI to populate these, or click on them with an itemstack in your hand while in the GUI.

To filter entities, use either a spawn egg or creature catcher.

You can also toggle the 'allow vs deny' list button. In allow mode, only items listed will be affected, while in deny mode,anything BUT the items listed will be affected.

Compare NBT can be used to be more specific in your filters, such as having to match enchantments or damage on a tool, or filtering a specific color of sheep if using a creature catcher.
