# Item Collector

The item collector works like an [Advanced Machine](./mach_advanced_controls.md), despite being made with Tier 1 resources.  It will vacuum up any item entites in it's area of effect, and deposit them in the inventory it's attached to.

You can filter which items are picked up in the GUI, and increase the pickup speed if desired.
