# Simple Coal Generator

The Simple Coal Generator is a basic machine for generating energy. While you can use simple fuels, like any furnace burnable fuel, it can also use various tiers of specialized coal to generate Forge Energy (FE). Higher tiers of coal, such as [Primal Coal](./res_coal_t1.md), [Blaze Ember](./res_coal_t2.md), [Voidflame Coal](./res_coal_t3.md), and [Eclipse Ember](./res_coal_t4.md), increase both the FE per tick (FE/T) and total FE generated.

Each upgrade in coal tier results in more efficient energy production, allowing for longer operations and more power output from the same amount of coal.
