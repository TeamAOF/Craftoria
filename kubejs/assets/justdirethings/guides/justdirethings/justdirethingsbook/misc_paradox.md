# Paradox

**Warning!!**

The paradox is an unstable spacetime event brought on by overuse of the [Paradox Machine](./mach_paradox.md).

The paradox starts out small, but over time will grow larger. The larger it grows, the more it will be able to consume.

The paradox will absorb any blocks, items, or entities in its area of effect. Once they've been consumed, theres no getting them back! Where did they go? No one really knows.

The only thing we do know, is that the more it consumes, the faster it grows!

Luckily there seems to be a limit to its size.

At this time very little is known about The Paradox. The only thing scientists have been able to determine so far, is that it can be sealed shut by feeding it a [Time Crystal](./res_time_crystal.md).

Tossing one in should do the trick.

There will likely be more to come as studies advance.
