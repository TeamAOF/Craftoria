# Negate Fall Damage

Protect yourself from accidental falls with the Negate Fall Damage upgrade. This upgrade absorbs all fall damage, ensuring your safe landing.

Note: It uses energy to soften your fall. The more damage it blocks, the more energy it uses. Celestigem boots don't have a ton of energy....
