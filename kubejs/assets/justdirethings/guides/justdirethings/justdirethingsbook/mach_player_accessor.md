# Player Accessor

The Player Accessor is a unique utility block that facilitates direct interaction with a player's inventory. It allows external systems like hoppers or pipes to insert or extract items directly from a player's inventory, effectively bridging the gap between player and automated storage solutions.

The UI buttons let you toggle which side accesses which inventory slots.

For example, you can set it so that insert into the 'top' face equips or removes armor, and the bottom face interacts with your offhand slot.
