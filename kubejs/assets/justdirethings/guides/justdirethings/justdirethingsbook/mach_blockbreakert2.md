# Advanced Block Breaker

The advanced block breaker is an upgraded version of the [Simple Block Breaker](./mach_blockbreakert1.md). It can break blocks in a much larger area. Details of each feature of the UI follow.

**Filter Block vs Filter Item.**

The filter section allows you to specify what blocks to break. 

In 'filter block' mode, this will let you specify which BLOCKS to break. For example, if you place cobblestone in there, it will only break cobblestone blocks.

In filter ITEMS mode, it specifies which item drops to allow. For example, if you place cobblestone in there, it can break either stone or cobblestone, since breaking stone will drop cobblestone (unless the pick has silk touch).

**Direction Button.**

The direction button lets you specify which block face to break from. Normally this doesn't matter, but if your tool has a 'hammer' like ability, it lets you specify which 'side' of the block you're hitting when you break it, so you can control the hammers direction.
