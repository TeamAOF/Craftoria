# Paradox Machine

The paradox machine is the next evolution in Time Manipulation Technology!

It allows you to take a 'snapshot' of an area of the world, recording the entities and blocks that exist at the moment you click the button.

This machine can rewind time to the point where those things existed.

First, place the machine in the world, and designate an area of effect like with most advanced machines.

Second, place any Blocks (Raw Ores only!) or Entities (Zombies, cows, etc) into the area of effect that you'd like to save.

Finally, click the 'snapshot' button in the machine's UI.

Now, the machine will need a significant amount of both Power and Time Fluid.  After clearing the area of blocks or entities, activate the machine. The blocks and entities you've cleared will be restored!

Note: A button on the UI allows you to toggle between Entities Only, Blocks Only, or both.

Now, technically speaking, the Paradox Machine doesn't exactly revert to entities and blocks from a previous point in time.

Its more like it is grabbing that entity from a parallel universe at a prior point in its own time stream. Its all very technical!

What this means is the entities may not be EXACTLY identical to the one you snapshot.

**WARNING!!!**

Overuse of this machine can lead to some corruption of the space time continuum.  A dangerous side effect known as the [Paradox](./misc_paradox.md) can appear after extended use! The machine will track the buildup of paradox energy, and represent it on the UI.

User Discretion is Advised.

They should really print the warning before the spell.
