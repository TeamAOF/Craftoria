# Simple Fluid Placer

The Simple Fluid Placer allows you to automate the placement of fluids in the world, much like its partner block the [Simple Placer](./mach_blockplacert1.md) does with blocks.

It has a slot in the UI for inserting buckets, or other fluid containing items like the Fluid Canister.

On the left side of the UI is a fluid tank, indicating which fluid is stored in the machine. If more than 1,000mb of fluid are available, and there isn't already a fluid or block in front of the machine, it will place the fluid into the world.
