# Advanced Block Placer

The Advanced Block Placer is an upgraded version of the [Simple Block Placer](./mach_blockplacert1.md).

Use the filters to specify which blocks can be placed on. For example, filtering stone will only allow the placer to place on stone blocks. This filter also respects the direction setting, if set to 'down' it will only place on TOP of stone blocks.
