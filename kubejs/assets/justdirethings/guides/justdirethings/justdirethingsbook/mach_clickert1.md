# Simple Clicker

The Simple Clicker simulates a right-click, left-click, or even holding-click actions! It is useful for automating interactions like clicking buttons or attacking mobs.

The UI is complex, so lets detail it in the following pages.

The slot in the UI is what item should be used to click with.  This could be sheers for sheering sheep, or a sword for attacking mobs. It can also be left empty, if you want to click a button.

The **show fake player** button will show (using particles in world) the direction the click will occur, based on the **direction** button.

The **sneak** button will toggle 'sneak' clicking, which will simulate what happens if you sneak-click an item.

The **click button** will toggle between right click, left click, and hold click, which indicates which kind of click to use. Left click for attacking, for example, and hold click for a trident. The number under hold click is how long to hold it for before releasing.

The **target** button which specify which type of thing to click on. Target **blocks** will only click on a block in that space, while target **air** will only click if there is NOT a block in that space.

Target **Hostile** will only click on hostile mobs, like zombies, while target **passive** only hits non-hostiles, like sheep or pigs.

Target **Adult** will only hit adult mobs, like fully grown zombies or sheep, while target **child** will only target babies, like baby cows or baby zombies.

Target **Player** will only affect players.

Finally, target **all living** affects any living creature, be it a player, zombie, or baby sheep.
