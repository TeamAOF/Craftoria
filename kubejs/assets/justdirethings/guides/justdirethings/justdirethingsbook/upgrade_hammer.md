# Hammer

Expand your mining capabilities with the Hammer upgrade. This powerful tool upgrade allows you to break multiple blocks at once, making mining faster and more efficient.

On the blazegold pickaxe, it will mine 3x3. Celestigem allows you to upgrade to 5x5, and eclipse alloy pickaxes can do 7x7. Click on the upgrade button in the UI to toggle modes.
