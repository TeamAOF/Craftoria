# Tree Feller

Treefeller is a passive ability that goes on Ferricore Axes and above. When you break a piece of wood, it will break any adjacent matching wood blocks at the same time.

Chop down those trees in a single swing!

Note: Chopping down an entire tree at once takes a bit longer than a single block!
