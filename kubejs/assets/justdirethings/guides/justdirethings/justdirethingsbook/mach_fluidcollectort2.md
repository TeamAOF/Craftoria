# Advanced Fluid Collector

Building on the [Simple Fluid Collector](./mach_fluidcollectort1.md), the Advanced Fluid Collector can collect fluids from a larger area, and offers the ability to filter upon which fluids are collected.

Simply place a bucket of the appropriate fluid in the filter slots to filter which fluids can be picked up.
