# Insta-Break

Speed through your mining tasks with the Insta-Break upgrade. Equipped tools can instantly break blocks, thanks to the addition of [Time Crystals](./res_time_crystal.md), drastically reducing the time it takes to gather materials.

Note: Energy use significantly increases based on the hardness of the block. Obsidian costs far more energy to instantly break than stone does.
