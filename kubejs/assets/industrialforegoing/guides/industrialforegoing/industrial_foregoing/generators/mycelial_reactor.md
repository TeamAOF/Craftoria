# Mycelial Reactor

Using the <Color id="gold">Mycelial Network</Color> (A subspace domain containing a living vegetative mass of fungus called the mycelium) this reactor can detect the other <Color id="gold">mycelial generators</Color> and generate massive amounts of FE. 

For this to happen, once instance of each generator needs to be working at the same time.

Maybe new technologies can be discovered in the future using this network.

**TODO:** Unsupported Patchouli page type **industrialforegoing:dissolution**
