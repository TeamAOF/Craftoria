# Conveyors

Conveyors can be used to transport items, entities and fluids. They can interact with the world using [upgrades](./conveyor_upgrades.md). Items and entities can go up and down on the conveyors but fluids can only go horizontal.

Conveyors can be colored by right-clicking them with a dye.

Using glowstone can make the conveyors move items and entities very fast.

<ItemImage id="industrialforegoing:plastic" />

Using plastic will prevent items from being picked up when they are on top of a conveyor.
