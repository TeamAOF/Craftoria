# Fluid Transporter

Fluid Transporter can be used to transport fluids between inventories that are 1 block away. You need to have a transporter in the extraction side and in the insertion side.

Multiple transporter types can be in the same block and they have insertion modes and extraction modes. To change modes modes you need to right-click the middle area.

You can filter things interacting in the GUI with blacklist and whitelist modes. 

To remove upgrades or a transporter you can Sneak + Right + Clicking one of the transporters. 

In regulator mode when a transporter is in insertion mode you can specify how many item/fluid an inventory can have.

You can speed how fast a transporter work with Speed Addons and you can transfer more using Efficiency Addons by right-clicking them in the outer ring of the transporter.
