# Water Condensator

A machine that generates <Color id="gold">water</Color> from surrounding sourceblocks.

When adjacent to at least <Color id="gold">2 water source blocks</Color>, it will start working.
Adding additional source blocks and supplying <Color id="gold">1000RF per operation</Color>, will make the machine significally faster.
