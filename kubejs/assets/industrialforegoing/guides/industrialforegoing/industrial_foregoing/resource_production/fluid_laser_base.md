# Fluid Laser Base

When fully charged with a [Laser Drill](./laser_drill.md) it will fluids. To do it will need a specific catalyst that won't be consumed and the machine will need to be placed in an specific biome and be drilling at a specific depth. 

Some fluids might need an entity under the machine to produce the fluid. 

Check JEI for values.
