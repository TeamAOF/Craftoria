# Mechanical Dirt

Imbued with unknown technology, this block will spawn <Color id="gold">mobs</Color> at a fast rate when certain conditions are met.

Firstly, it requires <Color id="gold">1000</Color>RF and <Color id="gold">20mb</Color> of <Color id="gold">Liquid Meat</Color> per operation, secondly, normal mob spawn conditions have to be met (this means the light level has to be <Color id="gold">7</Color> or lower and the block has to be loaded)



When one block is supplied with <Color id="gold">Power</Color> or <Color id="gold">Liquid Meat</Color>, it will automatically be equally divided by any connected blocks.

**TODO:** Unsupported Patchouli page type **industrialforegoing:dissolution**

```
{"type":"industrialforegoing:dissolution","recipe":"industrialforegoing:dissolution_chamber/mechanical_dirt"}
