# Plant Gatherer

A machine used to <Color id="gold">chop</Color> trees and <Color id="gold">harvest</Color> crops. Each operation creates a little bit of [Sludge](./sludge.md). 

If the Plant Gatherer begins to harvest a tree within the working area, it will continue to harvest any log or leaves connected to the base log block.

The Plant Gatherer will break crops when harvesting, even when the plant may be harvested by right click. But if its being provided with small amounts of ether it will replant automatically.
