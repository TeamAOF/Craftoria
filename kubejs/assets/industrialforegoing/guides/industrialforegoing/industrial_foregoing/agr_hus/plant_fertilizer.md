# Plant Fertilizer

A machine used to <Color id="gold">apply</Color> bonemeal to plants. 

The machine will continue applying fertilizer to the same crop until it can no longer accept bonemeal before moving on to the next plant. This can cause the machine to get stuck on plants that will always accept bonemeal, such as <Color id="gold">Sunflowers</Color>, or plants that will never reach their final growth state.

The Plant Fertilizer will accept: 

- Bone Meal 
- Fertilizer
