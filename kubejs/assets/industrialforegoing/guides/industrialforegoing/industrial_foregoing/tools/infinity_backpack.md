# Infinity Backpack

The Infinity Backpack is a tool that allows you to store big amounts of items in a portable way.

It can hold 3 specific fluids: <Color id="gold">biofuel</Color> to allow automatic operations to function, <Color id="gold">essence</Color> from the picked up experience (when auto-pickup is enabled) and <Color id="gold">liquid meat</Color> to feed you automatically.

When <Color id="gold">Magnet Mode</Color> is enabled nearby items will be teleported to the player when they can be picked up. 

When <Color id="gold">Auto-Pickup Mode</Color> is enabled items that can go in the backpack picked up by the player it will go into the backpack automatically. 

Each slot can be configured to <Color id="gold">void</Color> excess or to <Color id="gold">refill</Color> stacks that aren't full in your inventory.
