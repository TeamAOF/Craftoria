# Infinity Nuke

The Infinity Nuke is a tool of mass destruction where explosion radius will increased based on the tier and the amount of biofuel in it. The Nuke won't destroy things in claimed chunks. 

To make it explode you need to place it on the ground, right click it to arm it and right click it with a flint & steel to make it explode.

**TODO:** Unsupported Patchouli page type **industrialforegoing:dissolution**
