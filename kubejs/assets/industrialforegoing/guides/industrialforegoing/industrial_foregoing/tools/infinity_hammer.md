# Infinity Hammer

The Infinity Hammer is a tool that allows you to damage enemies in an area. Increasing the tier will give you access to different levels of <Color id="gold">Beheading</Color>, allowing you to get mob heads easily.

When right clicked into the ground it will make a <Color id="gold">shatter</Color> effect into the ground in a cone shape in front of the user.

**TODO:** Unsupported Patchouli page type **industrialforegoing:dissolution**
