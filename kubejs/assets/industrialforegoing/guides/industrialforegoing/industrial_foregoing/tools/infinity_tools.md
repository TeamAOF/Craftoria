# Infinity Tools

The Infinity Tools follow a simple principle, the more power they have the better they are. Increasing the tier might give the tool special perks. Having [biofuel](../generators/biofuel.md) in them will make them more efficient by consuming the fuel instead of power when used.

You can <Color id="gold">Sneak+Right Click</Color> to open the tool GUI.

You can disable the <Color id="gold">charging</Color> of the tool by disabling charging in the tool GUI.

There are 7 tiers:

- Poor
- Common
- Uncommon
- Rare
- Epic
- Legendary
- Artifact

All tools will teleport the drops to the player.

You can get special <Color id="gold">Shiny</Color> version of the tool by becoming a patreon. It will give you visual rewards!
