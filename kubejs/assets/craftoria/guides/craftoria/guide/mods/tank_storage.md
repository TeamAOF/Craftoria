# Tank Storage

Tank Storage, as the name suggests, is a mod that adds tanks to store fluids. There are 7 tiers of tanks, each with a different storage capacity.

## Tanks

Different tiers of tanks have different storage capacities. Here's a list of all the tanks:

<ItemGrid>
  <ItemIcon id="tankstorage:tank_1" />
  <ItemIcon id="tankstorage:tank_2" />
  <ItemIcon id="tankstorage:tank_3" />
  <ItemIcon id="tankstorage:tank_4" />
  <ItemIcon id="tankstorage:tank_5" />
  <ItemIcon id="tankstorage:tank_6" />
  <ItemIcon id="tankstorage:tank_7" />
</ItemGrid>

The first tier of tank can store 4 buckets of a fluid, and 3 different fluids.

While the last tier can store up to 1,000,000 buckets of a fluid, and 27 different fluids.

## Tank Link

<ItemGrid>
  <ItemIcon id="tankstorage:tank_link" />
</ItemGrid>

Tank Links are a copy of the tank that was used to craft them. They have the same inventory as the tank they were copied from. Meaning you can have multiple tanks with the same inventory. This is useful for moving fluids around your base, or maybe even between dimensions.

## Tank Dock

<ItemGrid>
  <ItemIcon id="tankstorage:tank_dock" />
</ItemGrid>

Tank Docks are how you can use pipes and such to interact with tanks. You can place a tank, or a tank link, in the dock and it will have its contents accessible to the pipes. You could even hook it up to an ME system by using an <ItemLink id="ae2:storage_bus" />.

Note: Tanks set to bucket mode will only allow interaction with the slot that is currently selected. This can be used to filter which fluid is allowed to be inserted or extracted.

Set it to tank mode to allow all fluids in all slots to be inserted or extracted.

##### Tips:

- Be sure to make a tank link as soon as you can, and store the original tank in a safe place. This way, even if you lose the link, you can always make a new one.
