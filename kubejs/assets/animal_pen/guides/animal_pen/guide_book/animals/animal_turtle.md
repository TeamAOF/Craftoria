## minecraft:turtle (TODO)

<GameScene zoom={4}>
  <Entity id="minecraft:turtle" />
</GameScene>

<ItemImage id="minecraft:seagrass" />

Feed turtles seagrass to breed them and increase their number in the pen. This will also drop turtle scutes.

<ItemImage id="minecraft:diamond_sword" />

Using a sword or axe on the Animal Pen will kill the turtles and drop their loot.

<ItemImage id="minecraft:bucket" />

Use a bucket on the Turtle Pen to collect eggs. More turtles mean more eggs.
